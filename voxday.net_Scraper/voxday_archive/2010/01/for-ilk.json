So, if you’re interested, send me an email telling me the name of an application or game for which you’d like to make a mode.  I’ll confirm that we don’t have one yet, you make the mode and send it to me.  I’ll pop it into the software to test it out, then I’ll send you the code and you can place your pre-order.
