First, you can’t simply wave off the looks aspect.  That’s the single most important element of a woman’s attractiveness to men, not so much where you rate on the 1-10 scale, but rather what sort of signals you are using your appearance to send.  Most women make it very clear that they dress to please other women, not men, so if you do the opposite you will definitely stand out.  I’m not talking about “going to a nightclub on Miami Beach” clothing, as much as I personally like that style, but rather wearing your hair long and down, wearing clothes that flatter most of whatever assets you happen to have, ignoring whatever the latest styles are, and paying far more attention to what the men around you happen to think looks good on you than you do to what your female friends tell you.  Unless you’re trying to attract a woman, don’t dress in order to please them and their neurotic insecurities.</p><p>On the behavioral side, try to be aware of the presence of men in your vicinity.  Don’t huddle with other women in public places like a herd of musk oxen trying to defend themselves; if you’re with a group of women, sit a bit back from them and scan the crowd occasionally to see who is checking out your group.  Don’t look away from men who look at you.  If a man is looking at you and you want to give him a shot, meet his eyes directly and smile.  If he’s interested, he’ll approach you, if he’s not, he’ll smile politely, nod, and turn away.  If he looks away quickly, he’s probably a gamma and may or may not approach you; if he does he’ll do so in a shy, hesitant, and overly polite manner that will make you want to kick him.  Regardless, you’ve given the “all clear” signal, that’s all you really have to do.  Be friendly and straightforward, and don’t be afraid to talk about your faith.  If nothing else, it will protect you from all the players.</p><p>As for meeting men, I strongly suggest taking up a hobby or two that is male dominated.  You’ll meet lots of men at martial arts studios, gaming stores, sports bars on game nights, car shows, and the free weight room.  Set aside one evening a week to adventure into alien territory and you’ll meet more new men in a month than you have in the last year.  I’ve never quite understood how people try to meet the opposite sex in places that the opposite sex never goes.  If you’re hunting ducks, you don’t go to the desert, after all.</p><p>Now, you are who you are.  You’re not going to change that now.  But if you present yourself in an attractive and open manner, refuse to let yourself be a bitch or a wallflower, and content yourself with men who are in your physical and social league, you should be able to find what you are seeking.  The Bible even says “seek and ye shall find”, so the question you have to ask yourself is if you have really been seeking or not.</p></div>",
