If yes, here’s the story:  about three years ago I dated a very nice, Christian beta male.  He was cute and fit and honorable and I really, really liked him.  He really liked me too, but there was one big problem:  I lived in NYC and didn’t have a car.  He lived far away in my old hometown (a moderately-sized city) and it was really hard for us to see each other.  After three months, I was frustrated about the distance, and I ended it with him.  I know now that was stupid.  My only excuse is that I was young and I wanted a boyfriend with whom I could do fun stuff whenever I wanted, like other girls.  Also, I thought nice, stable, Christian, honorable beta-males were everywhere in NYC.  More fool me!  I soon regretted it, but was too embarrassed to call him.</p><p>Now it’s three years later, and a new job has brought me back to my old hometown.  I was talking to a friend the other day and I heard my old beau is still in my old hometown and still single.  I’d like to call him and tell him I have moved back and see if he’d like to get together.  He may or may not be interested.  But is making the call stupid and self-defeating on its face?  Guys?  How would you react?</p></blockquote><p>Oh, sweet Darwin… all right, my opinion is that it can’t hurt to take a shot.  Contacting him is neither stupid nor self-defeating.  You have nothing to lose but your pride, and that’s simply not worth a lifetime of cat-collecting.  To be young is to be stupid; we all make absurd decisions and do ridiculous things that we subsequently come to regret.  Most men understand that.  I think that if he is still as honorable as you say he was, he will be naturally inclined to at least hear you out.  And besides, you say that he’s a beta so he’s probably not going to be overly put out by the assumption that you’ve been off chasing alphas in New York City for the past three years.  (Whether you truly have or haven’t been is irrelevant.  Most men correctly interpret “fun”, in female terms, to mean sex with alphas.  Or at least marriage-inappropriate non-beta providers.)</p><p>So, once you’ve made the decision to contact him, what to say?  I would simply recommend calling him up, apologizing for being too young and foolish to recognize his true value, and asking him if he’d be amenable to letting you take him out to dinner or meeting him for drinks by way of apology.  If he seems open to the idea but reluctant, remind him that at worst, he’ll get free food and drinks for an evening.  No harm no foul.  Now, you don’t need to grovel – in fact you shouldn’t – but you will need to be open and apologetic about what you now regard as your regrettable stupidity and superficiality.  And, of course, if he agrees, you will have to bring your A-game with regards to your dress and appearance.  Stylish, sexy, and contrite is what you’re going for, not sackcloth, ashes, and “New York kicked my ass so I guess you losers in the sticks are my best option now”.</p><p>It may work.  Or it may not.  If he’s not embittered by the experience and your looks haven’t declined too drastically over the three years, I suspect your odds are pretty good.   But whether it works or not, in the long run you will almost certainly feel much, much better for having made the effort.  At least you will know; it is not our failures that we regret so much as our failures to even try.</p><p>Anyhow, that’s my take.  Other opinions may vary.  And on a tangential note: ladies, stop going to the Big City to pursue your big adventure before beginning your “real life”!  I’ve seen it again and again.  You are very unlikely to meet anyone interested in building a future with you there, you’re primarily going to encounter men who are in the Big City to have as many adventures as possible.  So, if you’re interested in pursuing marriage and children some day, keep in mind that the Big City Adventure is nothing more than a total waste of your market peak.</p></div>",
