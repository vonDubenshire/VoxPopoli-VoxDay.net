You’ll have to confirm your free account on your email.  Then go to our list of songs under “Mindclear”.  You can do this by searching or just click on the “charts” link.  Our songs are “This Song”, “Nock”, “Killing Your Dream” and “The First Star”.  Rate them out of five stars and make a comment if you like.  The important thing is the rating.  We’re already in the top ten with two songs at the time I’m writing this.  If we’re at #1 at the end of the week, Hugh Hewitt will play us on the radio.  Maegan will be thrilled.  Just one vote is huge, so your vote might be the one that puts us over the top.</p></blockquote></div>",
