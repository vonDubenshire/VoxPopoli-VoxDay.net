I’d like to see it become a statistical and analytical resource, like Calculated Risk, only more focused on the factors I consider to be more relevant.  My thought is that I would direct the content, including the schedule of economic data releases, produce the graphs for the data I track on a regular basis, and generally serve as the editor, but the brunt of the daily blogging would be done by the co-bloggers.  There should probably be three or four posts per day, including the statistical releases with historical charts incorporated.</p><p>While there are a lot of decent econoblogs on the Internet, only CR comes close to what I think of as a one-stop statistical shop.  What I’d like to see is something that is a mix of CR, Mish, and the Market Ticker, albeit with a more international flavor.  Ideally, there would be one European, one American, and one Asian blogger to cover all the bases.</p><p>Anyhow, if this may happen to be of interest to you, you possess a basic knowledge of economics, and more importantly, the time to post a few times per day, let me know in the comments here.
