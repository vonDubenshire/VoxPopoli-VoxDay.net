I do very much dislike their tendency to coast at the end of the game when they have the lead, which appeared again in the semifinal and is probably the best reason to pick against them tonight.  I prefer teams with a killer instinct, but the rivalry between Schneider and Van Persie combined with the bad form of Fernando Torres and the deadly dangerous left foot of Robben is enough to convince me that this Netherlands team will finally do what the Total Football and Bergkamp-led teams of the past could not and win the World Cup.</p><p>I have to confess that I am impressed with the Germans, though.

Unlike previous games, they weren’t putting shots on goal but were trying to dribble the ball in as far too many teams did this tournament.  And the Spanish goal wasn’t even close to being offside, so I have no idea what the Dutch were crying about there.</p></div>",
