But underlying that joy, one can also see an occasional glimpse of the stark terror of loss in which they have been living for months, if not years.  The young woman who completely dissolves into tears after being surprised by the man in the wool hat is perhaps the most revealing example of this.  It should be sobering to recall that there are 5,638 American soldiers, many more than were seen in this video, whose flag-draped return to their loved ones would be too painful to watch in a similar montage.  The dream of a free and civilized Afghanistan and a free and peaceful Iraq is not an intrinsically bad thing.  But even if it was a reasonably obtainable one, it is not in the American national interest and it is not worth the cost in American lives and American blood.  It is not even worth tearing these fine men from their wives, children, and loved ones for a time.  Bring them home.  Bring them home now.</p></div>",
