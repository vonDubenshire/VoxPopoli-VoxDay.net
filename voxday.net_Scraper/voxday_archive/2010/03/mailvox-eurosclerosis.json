While some still think it’s possible to hyperinflate out of the problem – which is really just a means of buying stability a little time if you consider the eventual fate of most countries that hyperinflated – there is a very serious timing problem even if the peculiar U.S. debt-money system permits such rampant inflation.</p><p>Once the fleets of money helicopters are sent aloft, it’s game over for the global economy, for everyone with savings, and everyone holding debt.  That’s assuming it even works; if it doesn’t work then it’s an instant game over for geopolitical stability.  So, Washington and the Fed don’t dare to issue the order until the very last minute… which means that when the next default crisis hits, there is a very good chance that they will not react quickly enough and the financial system will collapse in a catastrophic manner beyond the ability of even hyperinflation to help it limp along.</p><p>Perhaps the financial wizards who created this situation can find a way out of it, but I do not see one nor have I read anything by anyone that offers what I consider to be an even remotely credible solution.
