As will eventually become clear, Vox is not rejecting any of the suggested criteria out of concern for their potential effect on his theories.  As a general rule, it is a mistake to project one’s own predilection for intellectual dishonesty on others; at the very least, one should wait to see what the justifications are before passing judgment.</p><p>3.
