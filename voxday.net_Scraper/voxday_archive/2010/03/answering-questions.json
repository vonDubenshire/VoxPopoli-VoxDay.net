There is no question that there are divergent human populations; the genetic science is settled in this regard and only a scientific ignoramus would deny that race, in the form of a genetically homogeneous groups of homo sapiens exists.  But to acknowledge the existence of racial diversity is not tantamount to a belief in general racial superiority.  Each race has various strengths and weaknesses.  None are intrinsically superior on average; the relative superiority of one race in comparison with another completely depends upon the metric selected.

And it never will exist.</br></p><p><i>Why did you leave the US?</i><br> Because I anticipated that it was going to go through some very difficult times in the near future and I didn’t want to be around a bunch of deluded and disappointed people in the process of discovering that they were not, in fact, the most wealthy, most powerful, and most free people on the planet.  My philosophy is that it is best to leave Rome <i>before</i> Alaric arrives.</br></p><p><i>Why Italy?</i><br> First, collapse would be redundant.  Second, the food is good and the weather is nice.
