We can say that these vaccines are making a clean sweep of all the fragile. Now I bring you an example from the last hospitalization I did.

The latter disease, COPD in medical jargon, flared up after the administration of the vaccine. The patient had 88% oxygen saturation accompanied by strange tonic-clonic shocks. Since she was not an epileptic, I thought it must be acidosis due to the fact that the oxygen tank to which she was attached was at a very low level; therefore I took her to the hospital, as I thought the patient was metabolically decompensated.

But I can already say that the tonic-clonic shocks, which I thought were due to metabolic acidosis, had completely different causes, because the acidosis was immediately compensated in the ER with bicarbonate, oxygen, etc. but although the oxygenation level began to rise, the tremors persisted. So it is my opinion that it was a neurotoxin toxicity from the Covid vaccine, which my colleagues did not recognize because none of them diagnosed it. After all, even us ambulance doctors, if I dare to venture a suspicion of diagnosis, they take me for crazy. For colleagues, the vaccine cannot give contraindications, there is just a gap, a void.
