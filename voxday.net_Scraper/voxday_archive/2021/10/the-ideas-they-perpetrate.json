  "content_text": "Ace of Spades is now\ntalking about corporate cancer\n:\nEthan Van Sciver did a great podcast about what happens when you hire SJW political extremists in your company.\nHere are some of the main points, with my own elaborations included.\n1. Whatever your company used to be in the business of making, that is no longer your primary business. SJWs don’t care about the widgets you’re making. They take over your company and direct it to produce political extremist propaganda as its main product. Your company will only be permitted to produce widgets to the extent that widget-production helps fund your business’ new primary mission of producing propaganda and repression.\nIf your widget production interferes with the production of politically extremist propaganda, they will sabotage your widget output.\n2.
