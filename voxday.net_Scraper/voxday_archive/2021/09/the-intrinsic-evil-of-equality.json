  "content_text": "Bruce Charlton highlights an explanation of why equality is not merely impossible,\nbut intrinsically evil\n:\nFor some time now; William Wildblood has been probing-away at the concept of equality, and exposing the evil of its roots and application.\nHe has recently reached what seems to me a very deep understanding of exactly why equality has proved so adept to the purposes of evil, so comprehensively hostile not just to all transcendental Values or Goods (i.e. virtue, beauty and truth), but more fundamentally to God and divine creation.\nEquality is the great dogma on which liberal Western democracies are built. It might have seemed like a step forward at a time when the gap between rich and poor, powerful and weak was as great as it was, and the movement towards less inequality surely did bring certain benefits in the short term.\nBut the flaw that lies at its heart is now being revealed. If equality, and equality alone, is taken as the foundation of a culture then that culture will collapse into the lowest common denominator and it will eventually collapse altogether.\nEquality is totally contrary to human nature and to enforce it is to force human beings to live against both their natural and their spiritual instincts.
