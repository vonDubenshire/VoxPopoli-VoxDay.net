For it is written that you shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve.’” This verse teaches us about the authority that Jesus has over the devil. During this time Satan was trying to switch Jesus to the dark side. Jesus had to pass the test that Adam failed in the Garden of Eden (Gen 2:16–17; 3:1–6). Jesus refused to believe the devil’s lies and instead obeyed His Father. Jesus was tempted but did not sin (Heb. 4:15). Satan has power, but Jesus has ultimate power over all creation. When Jesus said, “Be gone, Satan!” the devil had to obey him (Matt. 4:11). We can be confident in the midst of any trial that God is in control.</p><p>John 8:44</p><p>Speaking to a group of Jews, Jesus says, “You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies” (John 8:44). Satan is the “father of lies” in that he is the original liar. Satan told the first lie in recorded history to Eve, in the Garden of Eden. Lying is Satan’s primary weapon against God’s children. He uses the tactic of deceit to separate people from their heavenly Father. Jesus knew this, and wanted us to understand the tricks the devil might use so we could arm ourselves with knowledge. Some of his more common lies are “there is no God,” “God doesn’t care about you,” “the Bible cannot be trusted,” and “your good works will get you into heaven.”</p><p>Mark 5:7-8</p><p>Not everyone believes in demonic procession, but Jesus talked about it in the Bible on several occasions. Mark 5 tells the story of Jesus removing Satan’s evil spirits from a suffering man. Mark 5:7-8 says “[C]rying out with a loud voice, [the demoniac] said, ‘What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.’ For he had said to him, “’Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!’” This, again, shows us that Jesus has the ultimate authority over the devil and his group of angels. Jesus can cleanse us of evil spirits and feel rejuvenated once again.</p><p>Luke 10:17-19</p><p>Luke 10:17-19 says “The seventy returned with joy, saying, ‘Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name!’ And He said to them, ‘I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you.’” The context of these words is the return of the 70 disciples that Jesus had sent out to evangelize and prepare His way to Jerusalem. The group was so impressed that Satan and his demons had bowed down to the name of Jesus, but Jesus already knew they were well protected. The fall of Satan that Jesus saw happened after Lucifer’s sin. In his pride, Lucifer had lifted himself up, but God had cast him down out of his original place in heaven.

Jesus quickly fought back, but it this passage shows us that Satan does have power. If Satan can do terrible things to try and manipulate our Savior, we should never underestimate his power here on earth.
