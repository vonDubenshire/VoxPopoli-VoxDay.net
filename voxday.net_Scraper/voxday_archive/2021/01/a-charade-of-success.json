It is a nice gig, I’m sure, so long as you don’t mind abandoning your kind, maybe getting killed at some point because it suits the narrative, and probably not getting to see your dogs in the afterlife.</p></blockquote><p>He’s right. It takes a manufactured name brand and over 100 paid employees to produce 4x more traffic than this site, which has zero employees and zero advertising revenue. Internet advertising is, like political book sales, simply another means of funnelling money to those who do what their evil promethean masters tell them to do.</p><p>Note that neither AC nor I are even remotely bitter about Shapiro’s fake success.

If the whole world isn’t worth the price of your soul, then selling it for a little money, a little fame, a radio show, and your name on a few forgettable books is a dreadful bargain.</p></div>",
