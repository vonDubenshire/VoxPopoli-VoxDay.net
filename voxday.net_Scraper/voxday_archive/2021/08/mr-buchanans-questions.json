  "content_text": "In which I answer\nPat Buchanan’s questions\nabout the failed invasion and occupation of Afghanistan.\nThe questions that need answering. Was not the attempt to transplant Madisonian democracy into the soil of the Middle and Near East a fool’s errand from the beginning?\nYes. First, the Middle East and Near East have zero interest in Madisonian democracy. Second, what the US empire has been exporting for the last 40-50 years is not “Madisonian democracy”, but rather, a foreign imperialism that wears Madisonian democracy as a skinsuit.\nHow many other U.S. allies field paper armies, which will collapse, if they do not have the Americans there to do the heavy lifting?\nAll of them except for the Japanese armed forces.

Everyone knows it is fake and gay and literally Satanic.\nWho lost America’s longest war?\nThe neocons who have run US foreign policy since the first Bush administration did.
