The resulting recursive loop glitch in the market technically has the potential to send the price to any number. We know this can go high enough that it obliterates the financial establishment, and I think higher powers (whether they be financial institutions, regulatory bodies, or governments themselves) have known this as well since at least January. They are self-serving, pro-active, intelligence-gathering organisations. These institutions are beholden to people with a lot of power and influence, and they really want to keep it, so they won’t have been sitting around on their hands waiting to lose it all.

It’s Sunday night, April 4th, on [r/]GME. It’s been a fairly quiet few days except: a couple new mods are announced, alongside some chatter saying they’re sus; rensole (supposedly accidentally) sends a server-wide discord message eluding to the sub being compromised; wardenelite gets banned for having self-promotion in his post (again). Then, suddenly all this information about fairly mild moderator drama is revealed. Rensole and redchessqueen99, the ‘celebrity mods’, claim they have been pushed out, and although other mods are insisting they weren’t, a bunch of accounts start hyping up that ‘[r/]GME has fallen’. The story gets muddied, and now people are panicking. Rensole posts a vague summary of events full of what look like subtle exaggerations and half-truths, portraying him and red as benevolent, moderate, and humble, says nothing to calm the fears the sub is compromised, then finishes by saying they’re both moving to [r/]superstonk – a subreddit that has existed for less than two weeks and isn’t even GME focused (allows discussion of distraction stocks like AMC).</p><p>In times of crisis people tend to cling onto what they feel is most familiar to them, and I think this was exploited here.</p><p>So next the spamming begins. I’d never seen this community act with such frantic haste, and I find it very hard to believe that every account endlessly pushing [r/]superstonk and bashing the mods was genuine – I looked at a lot of them, and although some looked real, many were only a few weeks old, or had long breaks before recently starting to post generic GME related content. During one of the quietest periods of the week, everything is kicking off, people are confused, and information is conflicting. The subreddit is bombarded with a broad message of ‘you should be fearful, uncertain, doubtful of this sub; act quickly, you don’t need to think about it, just trust in the celebrities; flee, come to [r/]superstonk, the safe utopia where you can finally let your guard down!’ So of course, everyone does.</p><p>And now, when people arrive on Monday morning, one of the busiest periods, it appears ‘the great migration’ has already taken place – you’re just late to the party. [r/]GME is a bomb site, full of spam and shitposts throwing out the wildest claims to make it look terrible, and urging people to move to [r/]superstonk. When people do, they find a heaven with friendly apes, excellent memes, and all the well-known users (because they are human and followed along like everyone else).

Nobody questions why Thornton McEnery, a Marketwatch journalist with (in my opinion) a consistent track record of releasing carefully crafted FUD articles, references [r/]superstonk on the first day of its relevance, while [r/]GME never got a single mention in the media ever.

Since he had a role of leadership in the mod team, if rensole really thought FUD was as simplistic and manageable as he makes it out to be publicly, how did the moderation team develop a culture of excessive paranoia and over-banning? He gave a strong impression that unification was important, and that he was self-aware of his leadership role, so why did he decide to change subs so unexpectedly during a period of drama and misinformation?
