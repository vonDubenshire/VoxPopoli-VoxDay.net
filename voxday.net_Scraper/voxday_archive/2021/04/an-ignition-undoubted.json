We were contracted by a group of individuals to investigate the 2020 election, specifically election-related data anomalies. The contract has us posting this message to this board. In our current investigation, our in-field investigators have interviewed dozens of people who have had direct knowledge of the election. These people include election server IT specialists, election officials, and five governors. We have also interviewed people who have, in return for anonymity, described illegal activities they partook to destroy or alter ballots and election materials. We have travelled tens of thousands of miles across the entire country by vehicle, have sworn testimony from multiple government officials, and video/pictured evidence from those who were paid to hurt the election. We were told things as private investigators versus government officials because those we have interviewed are in fear for their lives every moment of every day. To summarize what we have collected; We have crowd-collected proof detailing how the election was rigged, how votes were altered/destroyed/stolen, international actions taken by foreign governments in collaboration with multiple U.S. Agencies and elected officials, and have just recently discovered the murder of three people who had publicly disclosed their desire to step forward with election proof.

The DOJ has until 12:00 noon tomorrow to come clean. The information we have will undoubtedly ignite civil war in the country.

The vote-swapping was the computers trying to adjust the live turnout to massage it into the precalculated results, as we watched.  Even crazier, is this would mean even down ticket races would have been affected by this, from House, to Governor, to state representative.
