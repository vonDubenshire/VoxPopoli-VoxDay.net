See, Mullet had gone to a Lutheran prep school with these guys and had grown up around them.  Mullet, the enigmatic Lurch, and I had formed a fast friendship in class at Bear Creek High and they were anxious to introduce me to the boys.  So we met at Mullet’s house in preparation for a Friday night out.  My apprehension was abated when Marky Mark shook my hand, tossed me a beer, and made me feel as if I’d been part of the group all along.  It was like slipping on an old pair of comfortable shoes.

We left on Thursday night and got to our hotel around 6 p.m. on Friday.  The drive took us through west Texas, which incidentally is like driving through the bowels of Hell, and we were praying Tip’s POS would hold together until we got to South Padre.  One memorable night we went to this bar (I think it was Tequila Frogs but don’t quote me) and mainlined tequila (ever after pronounced ta-kill-ya) for a few hours.  Afterwards Tip, Mullet Man, Hop-along, Hollywood, and I broke out the golf clubs and played midnight nude golf on the beach.  Marky Mark, the Whiner, Lurch, and Leonardo headed back to the hotel to sleep of their bender.  Once we got bored with smacking around a golf ball we went exploring and found a golf cart that belonged to one of the hotels.  Being the drunk and butt naked dumbasses we were we decided to abscond with our new mode of transportation and drove around for a while.  Somehow we found a pier and proceeded to drive the cart into the water.  Laughing and flailing we scrambled back to shore, put our now soaking wet clothes back on, and stumbled back to our hotel.  Somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico is a golf cart with our names on it.</p><p>There were those nights spent playing Risk and shooting the s**t until the wee hours of the morning.  Poker night in Leonardo’s garage was always something we looked forward to.  We’d get our paychecks on a Friday afternoon, cash them, and assemble at Leo’s and play poker until dawn.  Lurch showed up to vainly try to recoup past losses, Mullet Man loved the pizza we got from Beau Jo’s, and Tip always started the peanut war.  Lurch threw parties that were legendary.  These were the type of party where you sleep where you fall and his back yard always looked like the Jonestown Massacre.  Hollywood would host impromptu pool tournaments that usually degenerated into a giant smack talking festival.  Mullet’s mom always cooked the bomb ass dinner for us and the look on his father’s face was priceless as the nine of us ate him out of house &amp; home.
