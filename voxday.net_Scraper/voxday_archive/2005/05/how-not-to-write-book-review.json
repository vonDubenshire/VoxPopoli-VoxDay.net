I was sent free promotional copies of The War in Heaven and its sequel The World in Shadow by publisher Pocket Books so that I might review them for a different website I write for.

Characters pray everywhere. Now it’s not as though that sort of thing would be unexpected in a Christian novel; [X] is dutifully giving his audience what they want.

To claim that someone who does bad things does so out of demonic influence is not merely irrational but irresponsible. People who do bad things should be held accountable for their actions. “The devil made them do it” unjustly absolves those people of being held accountable and clouds the real reasons behind why someone might do a bad thing.
