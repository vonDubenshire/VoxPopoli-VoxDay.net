As for marriage, if I find a nice, sweet guy who respects me (it’s a fact that you can’t really love someone unless you respect them, so I guess you better “turn” gay or prepare to be lonely for the rest of your life), then sure, I’d probably get married.  However, I sure as hell wouldn’t do it just to get married.  That’d be kinda pointless.  As for kids, I really don’t want any.

If YOU claim to follow God and Jesus, why would I, being a woman, want to be Christian?  If God controls everything, then he made Eve eat that apple.

To the contrary, I’ve found that it is those who work for many years in an office environment that tend to have their minds consistently narrowed until they lose the ability to speak about anything beyond sports, their work or their family.  True, there are many women who can’t seem to talk about anything but their children, but I’ve seen this habit afflict as many career women with children in day care as it does women who take care of their children at home.  At least at home, you have the opportunity to develop your intellectual interests; sitting around watching TV is a choice, not a job requirement.</p><p>I might note that I’ve worked remote for twelve years now.  Or, in less technocentric terms, at home.  In that time I’ve written five novels and three recorded songs, designed or produced five computer games, read hundreds of books, been nationally syndicated, learned how to successfully trade the markets, started a software business, run a computer hardware company and coached a kiddie soccer club to two championships.
