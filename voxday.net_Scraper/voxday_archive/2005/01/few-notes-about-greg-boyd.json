He is not what most people consider to be pro-choice, instead, I would interpret his words as attempting to help reduce the number of abortions by finding a limit that reasonable minds on both sides of the issue could agree on.  Indeed, you’ll never sell NARAL, NOW or Planned Parenthood on outlawing second- and third-trimester abortion and a compromise such as Greg has suggested would save an awful lot of unborn children.  From a sheerly practical, life-saving perspective, the compromise concept has a lot to offer.</p><p>Third, Greg is relatively apolitical.  He’s read my novels – one is even dedicated to him – but I doubt he’s ever read even one of my columns.  He may not even remember that I write one.  I doubt he realizes that compromise is simply not a possibility, not because the pro-lifers will never go for it, but because the pro-abortion forces can’t.  Eliminating second- and third-trimester abortions would put a large number of abortion clinics out of business and give immense momentum to the pro-life movement, and since the passionate abortionettes realize this they’ll never be able to give an inch on the matter.  They wouldn’t even back down on partial-birth abortion, you may recall.</p><p>In any event, Greg is a good man and has been used by God to lead thousands of men and women to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.  He has been a large and positive influence on many lives, including mine, and I will absolutely stand by him even though I have little regard for this particular idea of his.<br/></p></div>",
