President Bush is going to raise $250 million for a job that pays $400,000. Now tell me there isn’t something wrong there.”</p><p>“If you just want to be one of the guys, then cut your salary and make what the other guys make. They don’t pay you a lot of money to blend in. There’s a reason Shaq makes $20 million a year. You can’t just blend in — you have to lead the team.”</p><p>“If you’re working at Wal-Mart and have 10 kids, quit having kids.”</p><p>“Ex-teams are like ex-wives. Deep, deep down, you know you can’t stand them.”</p><p>EJ: “Auburn is a pretty good school.
