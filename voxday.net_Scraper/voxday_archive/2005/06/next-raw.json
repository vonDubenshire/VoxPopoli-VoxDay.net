I believe that He directed all of His intention and will towards transforming that final release of energy into a new and permanent state of reality.

To call this an archetype is not to reduce Christ to a mere literary construct — it is closer to Carl Jung’s concept of archetypes as essential “shapes” in the collective unconscious that everyone responds to on a level deeper than rationality is able to take us.
