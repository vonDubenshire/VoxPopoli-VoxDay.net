You don’t have to get physical, just make it very clear that you will not stand for it and if it continues, there will be consequences.  You’ll have to follow through a few times as they test you to determine if you’re serious, after which point most reasonable women will adjust their manner of speech accordingly.</p><p>Yes, there will be feelings hurt, and yes, you’ll likely be frosted out for a few days… depending on your predilections, it will be a good time to get caught up on your Bible-reading, video game-playing or Internet porn collecting.

The weakest, most contemptible little rat of a man is still capable of snapping your neck if you push him far enough.  Even overmuscled male bullies know better than to back a scrawny wimp into a corner from which he can’t retreat; if they won’t take that risk, why would you?</p></div>",
