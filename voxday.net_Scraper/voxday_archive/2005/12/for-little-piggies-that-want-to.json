Right now, I’m into curls, so I set a goal of curling Spacebunny ten times without creatine.

It’s now a race to see which will happen first; hitting my goal or blowing out my left wrist.</p><p>I hit ten reps just below her weight today, so I’m thinking about asking her to go on a bread-and-water diet until Tuesday, then weighing her and declaring victory.</p><p><b>3.

The Perfect Aryan Male and I used to do seven-hour Saturday workouts, although only two and one-half hours were spent actually working out.  The rest was watching football, steaming, hitting the sauna, having drinks and hitting on the waitresses at the club.  Sure, it wasn’t exactly the most efficient workout, but it was effective and at the end of the day, we’d still spent a monstrous amount of time on the weights and whatnot.</p><p><b>4.  Be reasonable about cutting down on your food intake.</b></p><p>Instead of eating nothing, decide what you want to eat and then cut it in half.  If you feel like seconds, drink a glass of water or make a protein shake.  Those shakes will fill you up, especially if you’ve just eaten half a sandwich.  Set aside Friday evenings for a cheat day, do a big Friday night workout and then pig out.  I recommend Khan’s Mongolian Barbeque for Minnesotans.  I don’t think anyone there will ever forget Big Chilly, all 6’1″, 165 pounds of him, outeating the U.S national shotput and discus champion there.</p><p><b>5.  Free weights are the key</b></p><p>Cardio is great.  Cardio is necessary.  But if you really want to get lean, you need to build up your muscle mass.  Muscle burns energy even when you are sleeping; TPAM once infuriated a girl who was trying to get him to go for a run by proving to her that he burned more calories sitting on the couch watching TV than she did while running.  Of course, he has triceps the size of my head, so you may have to actually go for a run once a week.</p><p><b>6.
