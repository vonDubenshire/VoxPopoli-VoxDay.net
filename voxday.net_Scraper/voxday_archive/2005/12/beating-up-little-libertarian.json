As I have demonstrated, many individuals, past and present, have subscribed to coherent moral codes which do not consider rape to be immoral or consider it at most to be a petty crime worthy of minor compensation.  Most people today do not even pretend to subscribe to a coherent moral code; they make arbitrary decisions based on their feelings at the time.  Christians are one of the very few groups who possess a coherent moral code which presents a rational basis for universality – I note that this assertion is supported by a vast panoply of non-Christian intellectuals, past and present.

I recommend a children’s book called “The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe” which might help Aaron understand this concept; if the book is too difficult, I’m told there is a movie which makes much the same point.
