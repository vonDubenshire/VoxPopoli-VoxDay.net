They are very good musicians, (Tommy Lee, of all people, speaks highly of them), and decent pop songwriters and one can often feel the potential lurking about inside the song, but it never comes fully together and clicks on all cylinders.  Ordinary World aside, I think Duran Duran has always been at their best when they attack a song, leading with the bass, and they just don’t seem to have the energy for that anymore.</p><p>In summary, Astronaut is good, it’s solid and it’s enjoyable if you like their style, but it isn’t great.
