  "content_text": "Bertrand Russell’s 10 Commandments:\nThe Ten Commandments that, as a teacher, I should wish to promulgate, might be set forth as follows:\nDo not feel absolutely certain of anything.\nDo not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.\nNever try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.\nWhen you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your\nhusband or your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not\nby authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and\nillusory.\nHave no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.\nDo not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.\nDo not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.\nFind more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement,\nfor, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a\ndeeper agreement than the latter.\nBe scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.\nDo not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool’s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.\nI don’t necessarily disagree with all of these points, but it is remarkable to observe far they fall short of the original Decalogue, even though the original was produced with considerably less human history upon which to draw.  Let’s compare them, one commandment at a
