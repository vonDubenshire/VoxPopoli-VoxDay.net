But the first 25 are more than sufficient for the purposes of discussion.</p><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; text-align: -webkit-auto;\"> <b>1.</b> Because<br> Jesus Christ is represented by the sacred writers to be as distinct a<br> being from God the Father as one man is distinct from another. “It is<br> written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. <i>I am one</i> who bear witness of myself, and <i>the Father</i> that sent me beareth witness of me” (John <a href=\"x-apple-data-detectors://0\">8:17</a> and 18).</br></br></br></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; text-align: -webkit-auto;\"> <b>2.</b> Because he not only never said that himself was God, but, on the contrary, spoke of the <i>Father</i>, who sent him, as God, and as the <i>only God</i>. “This is life eternal, that they might know <i>Thee, the only true God</i>, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent” (John 17:3). This language our Saviour used in solemn prayer to “<i>his</i> Father and <i>our</i> Father.”</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; text-align: -webkit-auto;\"> <b>3.</b> Because he is declared, in unnumbered instances, to be the <i>Son of God</i>. “And lo, a voice from heaven, saying, this is my <i>beloved Son</i>, in whom I am well pleased” (Matt. <a href=\"x-apple-data-detectors://1\">3:17</a>). Can a son be <i>coeval</i>(the same age) and the <i>same</i> with his father?</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; text-align: -webkit-auto;\"> <b>4.</b> Because he is styled <i>the Christ, or the anointed of God</i>. “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power” (Acts <a href=\"x-apple-data-detectors://2\">10:38</a>). Is he who anoints the same with him who is anointed?</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; text-align: -webkit-auto;\"> <b>5.</b> Because he is represented as a Priest. “Consider the ….<i>High-Priest</i> of our profession, Christ Jesus” (Heb. 3:1). The office of a priest is to <i>minister to God</i>. Christ, then, as a priest, cannot be God.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; text-align: -webkit-auto;\"> <b>6.</b> Because Christ is <i>Mediator</i> between the “One God,” and “men.” “For there is one God, and one<i>Mediator between God and men</i>, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Tim. 2:5).</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; text-align: -webkit-auto;\"> <b>7.</b> Because, as <i>the Saviour</i> of men, he <i>was sent by the Father</i>. “And we have seen and do testify that<i>the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour</i> of the world” (1 John <a href=\"x-apple-data-detectors://3\">4:14</a>).</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; text-align: -webkit-auto;\"> <b>8.</b> Because he is an <i>Apostle appointed by God</i>. “Consider the Apostle,…Christ Jesus, who was faithful to <i>him that appointed</i> him” (Heb. 3:1 and 2).</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; text-align: -webkit-auto;\"> <b>9.</b> Because Christ is represented as our <i>intercessor</i> with God. “It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also <i>maketh intercession for us</i>” (Rom. <a href=\"x-apple-data-detectors://4\">8:34</a>).</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; text-align: -webkit-auto;\"> <b>10.</b> Because the <i>head</i> of Christ is God. “I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of every woman is the man; and <i>the head of Christ is God</i>” (1 Cor. 11:3).</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; text-align: -webkit-auto;\"> <b>11.</b> Because, in the same sense in which we are said to belong to Christ, <i>Christ</i> is said to <i>belong to God</i>. “And ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s” (1 Cor. <a href=\"x-apple-data-detectors://5\">3:23</a>).</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; text-align: -webkit-auto;\"> <b>12.</b> Because Christ says, “My father is greater than all” (John <a href=\"x-apple-data-detectors://6\">10:29</a>).
