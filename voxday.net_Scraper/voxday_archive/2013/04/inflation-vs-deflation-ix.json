To begin with, Z1 did not begin to decline in July 2008, as it peaked at $52.9 trillion in Q1 2009, a figure it did not reach again until Q3 2011, when it hit $53.8 trillion. 2008 merely served as the warning sign, as total credit growth ceased to keep pace with its 60-year historical rate, thus triggering two quarters of 10 percent growth in the federal debt sector in the latter part of the year. Gold and silver prices certainly did rise during that time, as did the stock market, but this was the result of the near-unprecedented increase in federal spending which was taking place at that time; even as the Household and Financial sectors contracted, the Federal sector expanded by $3.3 trillion.</p><p>Merely that Federal expansion, you will note, is considerably greater than the increase in savings over the same period. In fact, it is $1.2 trillion more than the total amount of extant currency plus demand deposits. And note that the government economists appear to have been keenly aware of the warning provided by the debt disinflation, (which you may recall was characterized as the “credit crunch” at the time), as the massive increase in government borrowing preceded the actual debt deflation by three quarters.</p><p>As Mises and others have remarked, inflation does not affect every sector of the economy at once. That is the whole reason it is desired by certain economic actors; they expect to benefit disproportionately from being able to spend less expensive money at its previous value. Nate’s tangent into malinvestment isn’t completely irrelevant, as real estate was certainly one of the primary areas of malinvestment, along with the health care and higher education sectors, but isn’t of particular importance because my case is not dependent upon housing prices. I have merely pointed it out because it shows that the inflation, despite massive reinflationary efforts, hasn’t been enough to counteract four years of ongoing credit contraction across the economy.</p><p>Nate is looking at Z1 – or to be more precise, L1 – as a whole rather than in its component parts. This is not unreasonable, but unless one looks at the component parts, one cannot understand the importance or the consequences of the shift in the nature of the credit market that has seen the federal element double from 10.3 percent of the entire credit market to the current 20.6 percent.</p><p>What Nate sees as evidence of inflation, the modestly higher prices in the gold, silver, and equity markets, is largely limited to the areas of direct federal intervention.  This is why health care and higher education prices are still rising to new heights, while real estate prices are struggling to get back to where they were.  The areas that are reaching new heights are where the outstanding $11.6 trillion in government credit is flowing.  That is where the malinvestment is still being directed.</p><p>I will not dig further into Nate’s answers. I don’t know the answer to them either, the point was to direct attention to what Nate sees as significant, which is the total amount of savings and the cash in the various banks. What Cyprus should have sufficed to demonstrate was that the greater part of the “savings” he cites do not exist in any material capacity except as debt claims.  As has been repeatedly pointed out here, deposits are legally defined as debts owed by the bank to the depositor and therefore qualify as credit money even before they are subsequently loaned out, and “multiplied”.</p><p>Now, Nate concludes with citing the 56 recorded historical incidents of hyperinflation. It is true that hyperinflation is possible within a nominal credit money system, (especially in the broader sense in which Mises and I question the existence of true fiat money), but that is not to say that all credit money systems are created alike.</p><p>I note that each of these hyperinflationary scenarios were very short-lived and tended to be closely tied to serious political upheaval.  The longest period is two years, which happened twice in China during the 1940s.  Note, however, that these hyperinflations tended to take place AFTER the wars or major political upheavals; the frequency with which they take place after independence is gained by a nation is reminiscent of the high inflation that plagued the American colonial currencies and the Continental Dollar.  If any hyperinflation were to take place, history suggests it would likely take place after the collapse and political chaos; it would be a result of it, not a cause.</p><p>What Nate omits to mention is that there have been even more sovereign defaults, which he concedes are deflationary, than hyperinflations since the first hyperinflation on his list took place in 1919.</p><p>Nate is correct to say that one must be careful not to mistake “can’t” with “won’t”.
