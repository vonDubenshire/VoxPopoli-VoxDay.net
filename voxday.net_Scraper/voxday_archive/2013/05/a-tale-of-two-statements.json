Membership in any program of the Boy Scouts of America requires the youth member to (a) subscribe to and abide by the values expressed in the Scout Oath and Scout Law, (b) subscribe to and abide by the precepts of the Declaration of Religious Principle (duty to God), and (c) demonstrate behavior that exemplifies the highest level of good conduct and respect for others and is consistent at all times with the values expressed in the Scout Oath and Scout Law. No youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone.”</p><p>Although the resolution has passed, it shall not take effect until January 1, 2014. The reason for this is to give us and our leadership time to adjust and prepare for the upcoming change. Many of you have expressed your opinions and thoughts on this matter, and whether this is right or wrong, do not let this affect the true core values on which the upon which Scouting was founded: to get our youth active in the outdoors, to instill proper skills for the future, and to gain the ideals of leadership and service in today’s youth which will help build a better future for our country and world.</p><p>The road ahead will be a long and hard one for our organization. Many scouts have already expressed their desire to leave the program, but I would like to issue a challenge to you all in the hopes that the Boy Scouts of America will come out stronger than it ever has before. In the upcoming months, speak to your fellow brothers about how you can help build our organization. Please do not focus on someones sexual orientation, but on what you yourself can do for Scouting. It is up to us as the leaders of tomorrow; to be the best we can for the packs, troops, crews, and other groups within Scouting. Scouts will be looking for someone to show them what to do. Let us lead the way by showing them Scouting is no different than it was before. Our focus is still to build leadership and skills for our youth and to give service to our local troops, councils, and camps and we intend to keep it that way. I am proud to call myself an Eagle Scout and Vigil Honor recipient, and I am ecstatic to have the opportunity to be a part of this great organization.</p><p>As a former Star Scout and member of the Order of the Arrow, my response to the Chief of the Coosa Lodge is that his feeble attempt to minimize the significance of the degradation of standards represented by the board’s action is not worthy of an Arrowman or a Scout, and that I am requesting the removal of my name from the Lodge to which I belonged because I no longer wish to be associated with the Boy Scouts of America or the Order of the Arrow.</p><p>The seeds of destruction have already been successfully sown by the homosexual activists.  Both the Boy Scouts and the Order will be rapidly following the way of the Girl Scouts, whose membership fell by 250,000, (about one-tenth), between 2003 and 2008.  The BSA membership is already only half of what it was in 1972; the mass withdrawal of scouts, troops, and councils should see it fall by another half in much less time.</p><p>Tolerance is not a virtue.  It is, as I have written in the past, “<a href=\"http://www.milobookclub.com/2006/04/13/on-virtue-of-tolerance/\">the sin of Jeroboam</a>“.  One would think that seeing one organization after another, one institution after another, decline rapidly after lowering its standards in the name of modernizing them would give the various leaderships pause, (for evil’s activists are never successful without the useful fools convinced by their false promises and tortuous arguments).
