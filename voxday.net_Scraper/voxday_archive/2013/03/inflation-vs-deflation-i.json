Turgot”, which is the first essay in his book <a href=\"http://mises.org/document/5827/Money-Sound-and-Unsound\"><i>Money, Sound and Unsound</i></a>.  In this essay, Salerno shows that there are fundamentally two competing ideas about money, neither of which are even remotely new, as both monetary doctrines predate Adam Smith.</p><p>Of the first tradition, which dates back to John Law, Salerno writes:</p><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p> In 1705, Law published his principal work on money, entitled Money and Trade Considered: With a Proposal for Supplying the Nation with Money.

The institutional centerpiece envisioned in Law’s scheme resembles a modern central bank, empowered to supply paper fiat money via the purchases and sales of securities and other assets on the open market. Also strikingly modern are the theoretical propositions with which Law supports his policy goals and prescriptions.</p><p>Law initiates his monetary theorizing with two fundamental assumptions about the nature and function of money.
