Despite the easy schedule, I doubt he’ll be starting against Green Bay in Week 12 unless the Vikes decide to tank the season.</p><p>Matt Cassel was admittedly mediocre the last two years in Kansas City, but look at the coaches and offensive coordinator he had.  He still has 82 TD and 57 INT with a 6.1 yards per attempt for his career. Ponder has 33 TD and 29 INT with 5.5 yards per attempt. Who is going to give Adrian Peterson more room to operate? I’m not saying Cassel is an All-Pro or anything, but he does appear to be a low-level starter as opposed to a career backup QB like Ponder.</p></div>",
