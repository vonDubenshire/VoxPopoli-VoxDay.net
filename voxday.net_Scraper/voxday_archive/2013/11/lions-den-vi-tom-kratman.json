As usual, if you would like to be one of the three book reviewers, please send me an email and I will send you a PDF for your review.</i></p><p><i>It is also worth mentioning that two of Tom’s books are free on Kindle Select today, including the first in the Carrera series: </i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Desert-Called-Peace-Carrera-ebook/dp/B00B5HJOFY\"><i><b>A Desert Called Peace</b></i></a><i><b> </b></i>and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Caliphate-ebook/dp/B00ARPJDLA\"><b><i>Caliphate</i></b></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Come-Take-Them-Carrera-Kratman-ebook/dp/B00FY443IW\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://www.milobookclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/kratman05-3.jpg\" width=\"210\"/></a>No sense in talking about Vol. V in a series without talking about the series.</p><p>Caveat: If you’re a staunch liblepr (liberal-leftist-progressive-red) the odds of you’re getting through the series without suffering a fatal case of exploding brain pan are, at best, fifty-fifty.  This is hilarious, too, because the main character, in the course of creating a one export economy for a small country – the export being highly trained formations of military auxiliaries – finds that he had inadvertently done what most single export economies end up doing, creating a partial “socialist workers paradise.” Nonetheless, every time someone buys one of my books a liberal, somewhere, cries or screams.  And remember: Every time a liberal cries or screams, an angel gets his wings.</p><p>I wrote the series to discuss a large number of different things and I wrote it to work at different levels, for different readings, by different people, at different times.  At one level, the first two volumes concerned how the current campaigns should have been fought and why everything has gone to shit.  Note that I predicted that <i>before </i>it happened, well before.  These were also books on revenge and on how one tends to become much like ones enemies.  They also discussed, incidentally, with the Cheng Ho disaster, the failed first attempt at colonization, the likelihood or lack thereof of a colonization attempt that mixed culturally incompatible peoples.</p><p>The next volume, The Lotus Eaters, was transitional and political, with a heavy dose of coup d’etat and drug war, the latter of which is a commentary on the silliness and moral cowardice of blaming impoverished Colombians and Mexicans for our societal weakness and idiocy.  The fourth concerned how to turn women into infantry, and get military use out of gays, the old-fashioned way.</p><p>Here’s a very brief excerpt:<i> </i></p><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p> <i>“Gather ’round, girls,” Franco ordered.
