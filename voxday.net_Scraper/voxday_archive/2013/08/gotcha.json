I previously pointed out that he has, on three occasions, (now four), gotten more than 50k visitors in a day thanks to external factors such as yesterday’s Guardian article. That was why I noted how, after first being exposed, <a href=\"http://www.milobookclub.com/2013/08/17/mcrapey-retreats/\">he backed down and belatedly modified his claim</a> to “up to 50k readers per day”.</p><p>So, for no particular reason at all, here is the actual traffic data for Whatever from January 1, 2009 to August 26, 2013, adjusted to reflect the metric chosen in his tweet.
