He owned the right defense, shut down both the enemy strikers thrown at him, and combined effectively with the sweeper to cover up the occasional defensive breakdowns.  He prevented two easy goals by getting back and clearing balls that the goalie couldn’t hang onto after making saves, and repeatedly launched the attack by coming up the line and putting nice balls on the ground behind the opposing defense for the strikers and midfielders to run onto.  The first goal and most of their good opportunities were started by long passes he made, usually to his favorite teammate, Jet.</p><p>We were all impressed by Ender’s first assist at this level. The other team was in the midst of a counter attack when he broke on a ball being passed to the attackers near midfield, intercepted it, beat an opposing midfielder, and then passed a through ball into the box for a teammate to run onto. The midfielder drilled it first time and the goalie never had a chance.  The whole team went wild as that put them up 3-1 and pretty much iced the game, which finished 4-2 after the other team got a late goal at the very end.</p><p>My 29th soccer season hasn’t begun quite so well; in our second practice I banged knees with a teammate who later inadvertently stomped upon my left foot.  But I’ll be fine by our first game and it should be fun to play in the big stadium that belongs to the new team in the league. Not that anyone will be coming to watch the old guys play, but there is something about night games in stadiums that brings back those old state tournament memories. I don’t know how many seasons I have left; I’m hoping to play five more, but regardless, I plan to enjoy the game as long as I can still play it.</p></div>",
