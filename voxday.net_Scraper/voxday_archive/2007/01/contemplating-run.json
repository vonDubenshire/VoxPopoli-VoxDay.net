Increase the power of the Nebula juries by having the short fiction jury submit its recommendations for the fiction to be published in the SFWA Monthly to the editor and by allowing the juries to REMOVE works that have qualified for the Nebula ballot.

Turn the SFWA web site into the premier online science fiction and fantasy e-library by providing freely downloadable works available in all formats from every SFWA member interested in contributing.
