I have focused on tournies and SNGs, recently came back to cash games. Well my finance told me today if i continue to play poker she can’t be with me. She told me it was wrong, that I shouldn’t be going it, that I was wasting my potential. I asked her if it was about money and she said no, even if I win million dollars she won’t be happy, basically she implied it wasn’t noble. I found that odd as I before this I was a commodoties trader, and I basically bought low sold high, etc ,so there wasn’t anything noble about that, but she seemed much happier when I was doing it. I quit because I like to work for myself and don’t relish the fact of getting up at 6 a.m everyday. I also left college at twenty to enter Wall Street, I always been a risk taker. Anyway I feel if I am being true to myself, I must stay with poker, but I don’t want to lose her, she is a good girl or I wouldn’t have purposed to her. It certainly isn’t the safest route, how retarded will I feel if I pick poker and then in a year or two the gov’t really does ban it and I end up with nothing. I spoke to my friends, but I like advice from you guys. What I am msot concerned with is setting a pattern. If she wants to change me in this, what else will she want to change me in? Or what if I get a regular job and in 5 years I get a promotion to another state, and she wants to stay here, then what? How far do you compromise? Love to hear from you Vox as you are the woman expert.</p></blockquote><p>First, there’s no such thing as a woman expert.

Being an entrepeneur and associating with many entrepeneurs, I know how hard the constant uncertainty can be on women.  Women hate and fear risk even though they love the rewards it can bring.  The key is to give them some sense of stability, of financial security, that will offset the inherently chaotic nature of the incessant risk-taking.

Promise that you’ll put away a certain percent of every win so that she knows you’re not risking everything every time you enter a tournament.  And put some parameters on your performance, so that she knows you’ll quit if you can’t make it work before completely destroying your finances.</p><p>If she still can’t handle it, then she’s simply not the right woman for you and the relationship must end.  This doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with her, it just means she needs to settle down with a nice middle manager who works at an office, makes 65k per year and contributes to his 401k every month.
