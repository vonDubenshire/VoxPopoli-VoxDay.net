And then imagine that of the remaining ten percent, nine out of ten have been voluntarily lobotomized in order to better fit in with the retards.  How much interaction could you bear to have with them, how much effort would you devote to make them understand what you are thinking?  How much pleasure would you derive from interacting with them at all?</p><p>This may sound frighteningly arrogant, of course, but it’s not as if I had no reason to essentially withdraw from the world before I turned 25.  I vastly prefer to keep the moronic world at arms length, even so, one can’t escape it entirely; it’s somewhat annoying to be considered a mediocre fantasy novelist when it’s possible that “The Wrath of Angels” might even be considered a brilliant work of social commentary if there were readers capable of grasping that the religious fantasy is only a thin veil over the real story.</p><p>(And no, I’m not going to spell things out, there are enough blatant hints right there in the text.
