Mathematical generalities.  Forget “probably”, I can state with absolute, 100 percent certainty that between 0 and 100 percent of the world’s population is atheist.

Attempting to claim the practitioners of Chinese folk religion, Buddhism, Confucianism and Shinto as atheists.  This is absurd on its face, but more importantly, it is a demonstration of a Christopher Hitchens-like self-refutation that completely demolishes his own argument if accepted.  Anon is trying to claim atheism is growing globally based on the idea that it once accounted for only .2 percent of the world’s population in 1900, but this argument relies on counting the estimated 12.69 percent of the global population that practice those Eastern faiths as theists in 1900 and atheists a century later.  Sam Harris makes a very similar mistake on this basis in his second book.</p><p>4. Ignorance of demographics.
