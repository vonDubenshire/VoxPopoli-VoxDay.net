Any technology that reduces the need to interact face-to-face with other people changes a person’s social patterns. Is this a bad thing? No, it’s just a change.</p><p>To say that it is bad is to say that change is inherently bad and we should all be living in tribal villages, listening only to live music, and never interacting with anyone outside of earshot or walking distance. Granted, thanks to the Internet I now have more communication with people in Australia and Europe than with my neighbor across the back fence, but on the other hand the people in Australia and Europe are far more interesting and intelligent than my neighbor.
