Unfortunately I didn’t specifically support their arguments – I said it couldn’t be done without a disregard for their lives and dignity.

It’s almost as big as the difference between the synonyms “impossible” and “unrealistic” that Merkur was previously complaining about.  Of course, if one does not kill people, THEN THE COST IN HUMAN LIVES IS ZERO.

I not only rejected that contention from the very start, but have even cited current examples that prove it to be false.  Of course, once I cited the Iranian example that proved my case, Merkur began distancing himself from the very statements he has been defending and quoting and echoing, though apparently not “specifically supporting”, from the start.</p><blockquote><p>Allow me to demonstrate the vacuity of your feeble semantic evasions. It has been empirically proven that a man can pole vault 6.14m – would it be impossible for “Vox Day” to pole vault 6.14m? Clearly not; with a high level of commitment, focused through an intensive training schedule, with the right conditions in place, it has been demonstrated that it is physically possible for “Vox Day” to do this. Is it realistic to expect “Vox Day” to pole vault 6.14m? Absolutely not; he is highly unlikely to be able to commit to this task, would probably not be able to fulfil such an intensive training, and cannot depend on the right conditions being in place. So it is possible, but it is unrealistic.</p></blockquote><p>I shall certainly allow him to demonstrate away, as by doing so Merkur provides a nice analogy to show how he is dancing madly away in an attempt to avoid having to provide an answer.</p><p>The question I asked was not whether “Vox Day” could be realistically expected to pole vault 6.14m, but HOW HIGH CAN “VOX DAY” BE REALISTICALLY EXPECTED TO POLE VAULT?  This is the answer that Merkur has repeatedly refused to answer, because he knows that doing so will destroy the last vestiges of his argument.  We already know that we are currently pole-vaulting the equivalent of 110cm without even trying, we know that the Iranians are currently pole-vaulting the equivalent of 3.36cm, so how high can we realistically be expected to vault?</p><p>Merkur won’t answer.</p><p>Moreover, the pole vault is an imperfect analogy because the height has to be surmounted in a single go.  Deportation is more akin to lowering the bar by the height of the bar cleared previously.  So “Vox Day” doesn’t have to pole-vault 6.14m, he only has to vault 3.1m twice, which is less than the Iranians have already managed.  Or 1.5m four times.</p><blockquote><p>I’m not evading the question, because there isn’t a question to evade. Practical issues do have practical answers, “Vox”, but you don’t seem to understand the practical implications of mass deportation.

Of course there are other practical issues.  There always are.  The aliens have to be identified.  The bus drivers have to be hired.  The contracts for provisioning the buses have to be awarded.  Congress doesn’t even have to pass a law, it merely has to leave the states and localities alone to do what they want.  But all of these issues are easily resolved in theory, and in any case, Merkur characteristically avoids spelling out what he believes to be the practical implications he mentions.
