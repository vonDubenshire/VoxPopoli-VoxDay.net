Debate is a skill like any other, and it correlates far more with the ability to think and speak quickly, than it does with being accurate. This is, in fact, why creationists insist on live spoken debates rather than written ones.\nTranslation: you’re going to get your ass kicked, so you don’t dare play.  I note that there is copious evidence that creationists are willing to make their case in writing, in both book and debate form.  Anyhow, I thought we were supposed to be the low IQ crowd, when did we suddenly become the side with the intellectual advantage?\nAlso, statistics would indicate that out of the hundreds of thousands of scientists, most of whom we are informed subscribe completely to evolutionary theory, there should be at least one or two rhetorically competent individuals capable of defending evolution from those wickedly sharp but wildly ignorant creationists.\n2.  What we on the scientific side of the debate say ad infinitum is not that the creationists are stupid, but that they are unscientific, and that they are wrong. Debating them as equals will give the impression to the casual observer that they ARE equals.\nThere is no shortage of evidence proving that those on the self-proclaimed scientific side of the debate do indeed say that creationists are stupid, one need only look at Pharyngula’s site to find far more examples of that than the cumulative total of transitionary fossils yet found.
