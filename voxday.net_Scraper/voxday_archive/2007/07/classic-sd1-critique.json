That’s truly rich. Someday, Vox Day is going to put together a coherent argument aside from just sneering and bickering, and I’m going to have to celebrate that day as real achievement in human progress.\nSo, let’s break down the argument from today’s column as it applies to Richard Dawkins and see if it is coherent or merely sneering and bickering.\n1.  Richard Dawkins was a scientist of some reknown in the past.\n2.  Richard Dawkins is no longer professionally engaged in the use of the scientific method, but is now paid to use his fame and talents to popularize science.\n3.
