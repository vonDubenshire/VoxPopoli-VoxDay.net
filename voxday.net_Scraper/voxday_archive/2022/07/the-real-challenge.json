  "content_text": "“To be anti-fascist or anti-communist is to fight with the shadow of the past. The real challenge is to be anti-liberal.”\n– Alexander Dugin\nIt’s very, very difficult for the good-hearted, well-intentioned peoples of the West, whether they style themselves liberals or conservatives, to understand or accept that all of the freedom and liberty and equality rhetoric to which they respond so emotionally is pure Enlightenment poison. None of it is good, none of it is real, and none of it is true.\nIt is all inversion.\nJesus Christ promises us freedom from sin. The Enlightenment devils promise us freedom from God.\nThe Old Testament defines liberty is freedom from debt and immigration every fifty years. (Leviticus 25:10). The Enlightenment devils define liberty as permission to commit sins against both Man and God.\nThe Bible tells us that we are all fallen short of the glory of God. The Enlightenment devils promise us equality with God.\nThe fruits of the Enlightenment have come to pass. Its evils are now undeniable and its precepts have proved themselves to be unsustainable for families, nations, and societies. The Enlightenment virtues have turned out to be vices that destroy the Good, the Beautiful, and the True.\nTherefore, embrace the challenge.\nDISCUSS ON SG",
