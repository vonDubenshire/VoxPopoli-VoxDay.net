  "content_text": "People often forget that it is China which keeps North Korea on a short leash. I interpret\nthis recent missile launch\nover Japan as a warning from China that if and when the Second Front of WWIII is opened, it will not only be the Chinese taking action.\nNorth Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan, for the first time in five years on Tuesday, prompting a warning for residents to take cover and a temporary suspension of train operations in the northern part of the country.\nThe Japanese government warned citizens to take cover as the missile appeared to have flown over and past its territory before falling into the Pacific ocean.\nIt said it did not use any defence measures to destroy the missile, which was the first to fly over or past Japan from North Korea since 2017.\nSpeaking to reporters shortly afterwards, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launch and called North Korea’s actions ‘barbaric.’ He noted that the government would continue to gather and analyse information.\nThe launch is the latest weapons test by North Korea in an apparent response to military drills between South Korea and the United States.\nIn fact, it wouldn’t be a surprise if the North Koreans were the first to initiate action; the major players are seldom the first to get directly involved.\nDISCUSS ON SG",
