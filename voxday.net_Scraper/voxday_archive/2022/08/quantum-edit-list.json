Changes are in bold, unless noted, applies to both KJV and 1611.</p><p><strong>Genesis 1:1</strong> – “In the beginning, God created the heaven<strong>S</strong> and the earth.”</p><p>So now it is heaven, no s.</p><p><strong>Genesis 3:15</strong>– This is the protoevangelical prophecy of Yeshua (Jesus) Messiah….This is a <strong>HUGE</strong> deal.</p><p>“And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall crush thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”</p><p>Now this verse says “it” shall “bruise” thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</p><p><strong>“stuff”</strong> inserted 16 times for possessions or belongings. <strong>Once in Luke 17:31 </strong>in the New Testament, all other occurrences in the OT.</p><p>Here are the other locations of <strong>“stuff”</strong>…Genesis 31:37 (2x), 45:20, Exodus 22:7, Joshua 7:1, 1st Samuel 25:13, 10:22, Nehemiah 13:8, Ezekiel 12:3, 12:4 (2x), 12:7 (2x)</p><p>Also, “stuff” appears once in the NT, as mentioned, in Luke:</p><p><strong>Luke 17:31</strong>… In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his <strong>stuff</strong> in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. –should say belongings or possessions.–</p><p>There is a small possibility that one use of the word “stuff” may have existed previously. That possibility is in Exodus 36:7. All others are definite changes. This is a different word entirely from the other Hebrew words now appearing as stuff. In the <strong>KJV Scofield Reference</strong>, instead of “belongings” or “stuff” it now says…<strong>“furniture”</strong>. I will try to get the picture linked on this…</p><p><strong>“matrix”</strong> used in five places instead of womb. Here are the verses in KJV and KJV 1611 that now say “matrix”: Exodus 13:13, 13:15 and 34:19, Numbers 3:12 and 18:15.</p><p><strong>Job 19:23</strong>…Now reads: Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were <strong>printed in a book</strong>! Used to be “written (or recorded) in a scroll”<strong><br/>Job 21:24</strong>…Now reads: His <strong>breasts</strong> are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. Used to be “his pails (or troughs) are full of milk…”</p><p><strong>Numbers 11:12</strong>… Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a <strong>nursing father</strong> beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?….Used to say “as a father beareth the sucking child…” Some other translations say “foster father”.</p><p>Comment here…We seem to have a problem developing here with neutering the male and confusing genders. In my recollection of Shakespearean era English, men’s “breasts” were “paps”.

In 1st Peter 2:24, it still cites Isaiah 53:5 as most remember it. There is reads: “<strong>by</strong> whose stripes ye were healed”. Most quoting Isaiah 53:5 from memory say, “<strong>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his stripes we are healed.</strong>”</p><p><em><strong>Now, on to predominately NT changes</strong>.

Neither do men put new wine into old <strong>bottles</strong>: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</p><p>Bottles has replaced <strong>wineskins</strong> in this and the synoptic verses. Additionally, “bottles” has replaced jar/jug and container throughout the OT. <strong>The word from which “bottles” is translated points to leather skins or bags.</strong></p><p><strong>Mark 2:22…wineskins replaced with bottles.</strong></p><p><strong>Luke 5:37-38…wineskins replaced with bottles.</strong></p><p><strong>Mark 13:10</strong>… And the gospel must first be <strong>published</strong> among all nations.</p><p>Was always <strong>preached or proclaimed</strong> before.</p><p><strong>Luke 1:35</strong>… And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy <strong>thing</strong> which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</p><p>Was NEVER “thing”.

This was either <strong>bed or mattress</strong> depending on the translation. It never was “couch” in the KJV…Fairly popular scripture in conversation…”Pick up thy bed and walk”. No one ever said., “Pick up your couch and go home.”</p><p><strong>John 3:16</strong>…Was…”For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, so that whosoever believeth in Him <strong>shall</strong> not perish but have eternal life.”</p><p>Is now…</p><p>16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him <strong>should</strong> not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p><p>Funny thing about this one is that I actually remember it both ways. Due to so much residual evidence of “shall”, I have to go with it.</p><p><strong>John 8:32</strong>….”And you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.” That’s what it always was. Now it is:</p><p>32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall <strong>make</strong> you free.</p><p><strong>Acts 3:19</strong>… Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, <strong>when</strong> the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord…..Used to be <strong>“and</strong>“.</p><p>Acts 4:27 and 30…27 For of a truth against thy <strong>holy child</strong> Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,…..30 By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy <strong>holy child</strong> Jesus.</p><p>“Child” was “<strong>Son” or “Servant</strong>“…Not child.</p><p><strong>Acts 12:4</strong>… <strong>Easter</strong> is used in several variations of KJV, many that people have been reading for decades and they are deeply offended that Easter has replaced <strong>Passover</strong> in their Bibles. <strong>It was always in the KJV 1611.</strong></p><p><strong>2 Thessalonians 2:11.</strong>..<br/>11 And for this cause God shall send them <strong>strong delusion</strong>, that they should believe a lie:</p><p>Many are certain that it said <strong>“a strong delusion”</strong>.

It always said <strong>scroll</strong> in this chapter although it did say “little book” and the “Book of Life” and “written in this book” elsewhere in Revelation.<br/><strong><br/>Revelation 12:12</strong>…<br/>12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.
