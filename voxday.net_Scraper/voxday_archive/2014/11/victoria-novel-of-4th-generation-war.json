It is also, much like <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> and <i>1984</i>, a didactic novel. It amounts to a dramatic instruction course on how the principles of 4GW are utilized, set in a near-future fictional version of America that is unfortunately not nearly as far away from reality as one might wish.

In the same week the West landed a spacecraft on a comet for the first time in human history, but the big story today is that one of the  scientists wore a shirt with girls on it and was forced to make a  tearful apology to the entire world.
