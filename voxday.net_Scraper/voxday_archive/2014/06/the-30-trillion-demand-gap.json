Household was positive flat, state and local government was negative flat, and financial went negative again after five months of being positive flat. The worse news is that the credit demand gap is growing; it has now reached $30 trillion.\nIn other words, that’s how far off the US economy is from one that continued at its 60-year pace of growth.
