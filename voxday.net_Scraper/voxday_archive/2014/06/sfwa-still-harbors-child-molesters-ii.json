Bud Webster wrote this in October 2013, two months after the SFWA Board informed me that it had voted unanimously for my expulsion:</p><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p> This is partly my fault because I’ve only just now looked at the “Authors Estates” pages, but why were those estates handled by family members or other private individuals listed with their full contact information?

First, recall that SFWA members such as John Scalzi, Teresa Nielsen Hayden, and NK Jemisin have been publicly attacking me since 2005. Second, be aware that I have had the entire membership’s personal contact information for more than 14 years and have never once made any use of the SFWA directory to send emails or make phone calls, abusive or otherwise. And third, note that John Scalzi was lying, and knowingly lying, when he tweeted: <i>“@jimchines The Naive Idiocy of Not Checking Your Facts Before Making Accusations Online”</i></p><p>Prior to posting the information about Ed Kramer last week, I checked the 2010 directory. I also checked the online membership list. Ed Kramer, the convicted child molester, <a href=\"http://www.milobookclub.com/2014/06/24/sfwa-still-harbors-child-molesters/\">appeared in both of them</a>. I did not check the 2013 directory for an obvious reason: I was expelled from SFWA and did not have a copy of it. Why didn’t I check the 2011 and 2012 directories? Well, as Michael Capobianco wrote in March 2013:</p><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p> I know a bunch of handbooks were sent out at some point a couple of years ago, but the Directory is a principal part of the new member packet, and there hasn’t been a new Directory since spring of 2010.</p></blockquote><p>Who was responsible for this failure to produce a new Directory between spring 2010 and March 2013? None other than John Scalzi, President of SFWA from July 2010 to July 2013. Which means that Mr. Scalzi knew perfectly well that there was no failure to check any facts on my part before I observed that Ed Kramer was a member of SFWA (and remains eligible for SFWA membership today). Also note that during those three years as the president of the organization, John Scalzi did absolutely nothing about Ed Kramer’s membership even though he threatened to leave SFWA in 2013 if the newly elected Board did not remove mine. He had no problem at all associating with rapists, sexual deviants, self-described savages, and child molesters. Nor did SFWA member and Tor.com editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden, who, nearly one year after threatening to leave SFWA if I was not expelled, published the tribute to MZB entitled <a href=\"http://www.milobookclub.com/2014/06/11/pink-sff-is-worse-than-you-think/\">“Marion Zimmer Bradley Gave Us New Perspectives”</a>.</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"> <a href=\"http://www.milobookclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SFWA_2013_p102.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://www.milobookclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SFWA_2013_p102.jpg\" width=\"247\"/></a></div><p><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ofSEkCYe8Ds/U7Coak_Ga8I/AAAAAAAAA1g/OZ1OXhUWAl8/s1600/SFWA_2013_p102.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><br/></a><br> I recently obtained a copy of the 2013 directory.
