We destroyed the fourth team 6-0, then watched as they played our neighbors without much hope of them scoring an upset. But their best player was the coach of our first team squad, and he ripped off an early goal from 25 meters that briefly would have put us in second place. Then our neighbors came back and took the 2-1 lead that they held until the last minute.

He pushed it forward a step, picked his spot, and put it right in the upper corner for the win with three seconds left. Phenomenal shot. The entire gymnasium went nuts. The upset meant that we were guaranteed second place in the group, and first if we could beat our rivals.</p><p>Unfortunately, we lost 3-1.

The competition. The physical testing. The going head-to-head to find out who is better. And the mutual respect that so often results from the process.

I know that. I accept that. The time will come when the young guys will blow right past me, when their speed and power will be simply too much to handle.
