There is hope that a man can find “childlike faith” and find again the magic and joy of belief.

It is rare praise to give to a novel these days, but, Mister Wright’s One Bright Star to Guide Them deserves this praise. I would highly recommend anyone take it up and read. It is simple because everything in the story is straightforwardly told with a wealth lying behind each paragraph. It is beautiful because it is true. The character, their actions, and their reasons all strike the reader as what those character truly would do or say. One Bright Star to Guide Them is, at its heart, a story of good and evil and the consequences of accepting each.</p></blockquote><p>But let’s not forget about his excellent <i><b><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/City-Beyond-Time-Tales-Metachronopolis-ebook/dp/B00L6WI3PU/ref=cm_cr_pr_sims_t\">CITY BEYOND TIME</a></b></i> either:</p><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p> John C.

Highly recommended.</p></blockquote><p>If you haven’t kept up with our new releases, I recommend that you do so now, because the good news is that we expect to publish one more new work by the SF grandmaster before the end of the year. We are also on schedule to publish <b><i>RIDING THE RED HORSE</i></b>, the new MIL-SF anthology series with contributions from Eric S. Raymond, William S. Lind, Tom Kratman, Christopher G.
