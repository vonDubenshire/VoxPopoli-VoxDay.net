Over the last 40\nyears, the world has gradually entered into a post-Clausewitzian state\nwhere the wars are undeclared, the battlefields can be anywhere, the\nuniforms are optional, and the combatants as well as the targets are\noften “civilian”. Conventional militaries have repeatedly attempted to\nutilize technology to meet the new challenges posed, but even the most\nadvanced technology has provided little more than meaningless short-term\nvictories rendered futile in months, if not weeks.\nThe inability of Western governments and militaries to come to\nterms with the changing nature of modern warfare has led to failed\ninterventions, failed occupations, and now even failed states everywhere\nfrom Eastern Europe to Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. And with the\nrecent mass movement of peoples around the world, 4th Generation Warfare\ncan be safely expected to appear in Western Europe and the United\nStates before long.\nDrawing on their decades of experience of military strategy, military history, and\nmilitary action, the authors have distilled 4GW theory into a short,\nconcise, easily accessible handbook that provides the soldier, the\nmilitary analyst, and the civilian observer with a guide to\nunderstanding and responding to the changing realities of this\nchallenging new form of war.\nWe’re handling this book launch a little differently than we have in the past.
