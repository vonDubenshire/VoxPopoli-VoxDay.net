The only question at this point is if the women’s suffrage experiment will be abandoned a) to prevent societal collapse or b) as a consequence of societal collapse.\nEither way, it’s not going to survive. Neither will democracy, or to be more precise, the present illusion of “representative democracy”, for that matter.\nThe statistical evidence is absolutely clear and undeniable. Sustainable human society is not compatible with the average young woman receiving more than nine years of education. Ironically, it may only be the inferior state of public schooling that has prevented US fertility rates from declining even more dramatically than they have.\nThe laws of social dynamics may not be as clear-cut as the laws of thermodynamics, and the effects of ignoring them may not be as immediate, but we now have decades of evidence demonstrating how ignoring them will prove every bit as catastrophic over time.\nDISCUSS ON SG",
