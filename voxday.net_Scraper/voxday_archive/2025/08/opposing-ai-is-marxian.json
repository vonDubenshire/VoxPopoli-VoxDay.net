Their argument, stripped to its core, reflects the labor theory of value that Karl Marx popularized—the idea that something’s worth comes from the human work put into it. This perspective, while emotionally appealing, fundamentally misunderstands how we actually value art and creativity.\nThe Labor Theory in Disguise\nMarx argued that a product’s value stemmed from the “socially necessary labor time” required to produce it.
