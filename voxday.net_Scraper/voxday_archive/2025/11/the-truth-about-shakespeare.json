  "content_text": "Dennis McCarthy provides\na useful summary\nabout the facts concerning the true authorship of the plays supposedly written by the actor William Shakespeare, but were actually written by Thomas North.\nHere’s a brief summary of the North/Shakespeare Story:\nThomas North (1535- ~1604?), 29 years older than Shakespeare, wrote plays for decades for Leicester’s Men (from late 1550s to 1588). These plays were performed in front of small, noble audiences and were never published.
