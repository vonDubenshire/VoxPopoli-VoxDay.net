He wished to stand well with his master, the emperor, and he ruled the bold Swiss with a rod of iron.

But when they passed the pole, Tell never bent his head. He stood as straight as a mountain pine.</p><p>There were servants and spies of Gessler in the market-place, and they at once told the tyrant how Tell had defied him. Gessler commanded the Swiss to be brought before him, and he came, leading by the hand his little son.</p><p>“They tell me you shoot well,” said the tyrant. “You shall not be punished. Instead you shall give me a sign of your skill. Your boy is no doubt made of the same stuff you are. Let him stand yonder a hundred paces off. Place an apple on his head, and do you stand here and pierce the apple with an arrow from your quiver.”</p><p>All the people about turned pale with fear, and fathers who had their sons with them held them fast, as if Gessler meant to take them from them. But Tell looked Gessler full in the face, and drew two arrows from his quiver.</p><p>“Go yonder,” he said to the lad, and he saw him led away by two servants of Gessler, who paced a hundred steps, and then placed an apple on the boy’s head. They had some pity for Tell in their hearts, and so they had made the boy stand with his back to his father.</p><p>“Face this way,” rang out Tell’s clear voice, and the boy, quick to obey, turned and stood facing his father. He stood erect, his arms hanging straight by his side, his head held up, and the apple poised on it. He saw Tell string his bow, bend it, to try if it were true, fit the notch of the arrow into the taut cord, bring the bow slowly into place. He could see no more.
