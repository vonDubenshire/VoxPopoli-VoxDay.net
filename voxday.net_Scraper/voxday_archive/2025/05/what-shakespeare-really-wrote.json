All you have to do is just believe your eyes.\nThe very first reference to Shakespeare in London as an “upstart crow, beautified” with the feathers of other writers evokes Horace’s description of a plagiarist as a crow who has decorated himself with the feathers of more beautiful birds\nThe first widely accepted literary allusion to Shakespeare appeared in the 1592 satirical pamphlet, Greene’s Groatsworth of Wit, allegedly written by the playwright Robert Greene.
