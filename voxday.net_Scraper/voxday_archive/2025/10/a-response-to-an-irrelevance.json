You were the first to provide real resistance to the Social Justice Warriors with Gamer Gate. Being first is important. Very important. Your books on Social Justice Warriors have stood the test of time.</p><p>You are among the first to achieve real traction getting important ideas into the minds of right wing intellectuals and activists: that conservatism is not enough, that Social Justice Warriors are a cancer that must be eradicated, that free trade isn’t working according to accepted theory, that conservatives need to play hardball and not play strictly by the rules when the the other side is cheating gratuitously.</p><p>As in a multi level marketing scheme, you deserve partial credit for those who have run with your ideas — maybe even a few orts of Charlie Kirk’s work when he has strayed into Christian Nationalist territory.</p><p>And you have deserved a well deserved rest from activism. You can retreat across the Atlantic to relative safety to focus on your family and on fun hobby projects with my complete blessing, with a bit of pontificating to the next wave of activists when you feel like it.</p><p>But that is not all your are doing. You have been repeatedly dismissing those who are are still fighting the good fight. And your repeated claim that those who have done greater things than you are disposable ticket takers is gammafied envy whining on the order of a twink Marxist sociology professor. It is more cringeworthy than your Mary Sue self insert at the end of Alt Hero.</p></blockquote><p>There is more, of course there is more, but it’s always projection with these nobodies and neverweres. First, he clearly doesn’t even know what a “fisking” is, since he doesn’t go methodically through whatever I actually wrote that set him off. This is a false assertion of a faux-fisking. Second, he’s the only one who took any offense. I’m certainly not offended by anything he wrote, neither are any of my readers, fans, supporters, and casual followers. On the level of rhetorical heat to which we have become accustomed since 2001, this barely rises to the 2/10 level.</p><p>These are his words, not mine:</p><p><em>“Offense has been taken. Great offense. For some strange reason I find the disparagements of a Benedict Arnold to be more offensive than the gloatings of an open enemy. Offense shall be served.”</em></p><p>There will likely be some who ask why I respond to an irrelevance. The reason is that I never use an critic’s irrelevance as an excuse to avoid addressing him. I have debated PhDs and authors of the textbook on the subject concerned and I have debated complete nobodies. Unlike Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, and Nick Fuentes, I do not generate excuses to run from either criticism or debate.</p><p>Let’s set another thing straight. I am not a “self described dark lord”. The title of “Supreme Dark Lord” was granted to me by SF grandmaster John C. Wright himself after the editor-in-chief of Tor Books described me as rising “all the way to downright evil” and after my VFM and Dread Ilk forced the tech giants to completely revise their legally questionable terms of service. To this day, I am banned from YouTube and officially barred from setting foot in Google’s Mountain View headquarters. And I am reliably informed by my eyes and ears there that my name can only be spoken in hushed whispers at the headquarters of the Daily Wire.</p><p>Now, the truth of my disparagements notwithstanding, I can’t be a Benedict Arnold because I’m simply not on the same side as Charlie Kirk or FM or Brilyn Hollyhand or Nick Fuentes or Ben Shapiro or any other conservative creature who a) is funded by foreign political interests, or b) believes “Judeo-Christianity” is real or c) subscribes to the idea that Western Civilization was ever dependent upon Judaism in any way, or d) asserts that America is an “idea nation” or a “melting pot,” or e) believes in Enlightenment ideals such as “free trade” or “free speech” or “progress” or “equality,” or f) supports the societal normalization of sexual deviancy, no-fault divorce, abortion, and euthanasia.</p><p>All of these things are antithetical to civilization in general and Western Civilization in particular. I actively oppose and reject every single conservative who espouses <em>any </em>of those ideas. <em>There is no us.</em></p><p>I am not, and I have never, ever been, a conservative. I explained why in <em>CUCKSERVATIVE</em>; it is merely a posture, it is neither a philosophy nor an ideology. I have never belonged to the Republican Party, or indeed, to any political party or faction. I do not care if the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, or the Democrat-Farmer-Labor Party are currently in power; I publicly dismissed all of them as the bi-factional ruling party back in 2004 and pointed out that the historical USA no longer even existed except in name and geography.</p><p>All of which is to say that I cannot retire from activism since I have never been an activist. I am neither a political activist nor a political extremist. I am an intellectual, which is something that is increasingly rare in an age of frauds, political whores, paid propagandists, and charlatans. I do not advocate, I observe and I assess. I do not think in binary terms, but from a probabilistic perspective. I certainly do not expect any political elites to pay attention to, endorse, or accept my observations, much less any of my recommendations, however correct they might be.</p><p>As a student of Aristotle, Martin van Creveld, Karl Marx, Friedrich von Hayek, Robert Prechter, Steve Keen, and Peter Turchin, among many others, I don’t view politics as being anything more than a superficial layer of distraction that obscures the real tectonics of human society, which are ultimately material and spiritual in nature. Modern politics across the West is a collection of delusional children playing make-a-wish; one has only to witness the incessant European conferences on how the member-states of the European Union, led by the European Commission, are going to institute regime change in Russia to grasp the fundamentally irrelevant nature of politics today.</p><p>This is not to say politics has no influence on society at all. But that influence is limited, indirect, controlled, and inevitably bows before material force and spiritual power. Moreover, there is virtually no link between the will of the people as theoretically represented by their democratically-elected “representatives” and what the people of the nation actually want. Very few, if any, of the institutions and policies of the current US federal government were ever desired by the American people, and yet they were forced upon them anyhow. The same is true of most European nations.</p><p>I very much doubt that most of my readers, much less any of my critics, can fathom how low my expectations are. We swim in a sea of willfully delusional retardery and none of the things that obsess most political activists matter in the least; forget who will win the electoral race in the 4th California congressional district or whatever as most people across the West will consider themselves fortunate if they preserve electricity, clean water, and indoor plumbing in their neighborhoods and avoid being roasted over open fires. All polities collapse in time, and the USA is observably approaching the end of its viability as a unitary governing entity. I’m not the first to see this; Wang Hunin observed the same thing years before I predicted a collapse in the 2033 timeframe in 2004.</p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-68913\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"777\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" src=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" srcset=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 512w, https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-198x300.png 198w\" width=\"512\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Politics is not going to fix this.</em></figcaption></img></figure></div><p>The irony is that my opinion of FM is not entirely dissimilar to his opinion of me.
