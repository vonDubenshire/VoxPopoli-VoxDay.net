This backer’s edition <a href=\"https://arkhavencomics.com/product/hypergamouse-coffee-table-book/\">is now available at the Arkhaven store</a> and <a href=\"https://ndmexpress.com/products/hypergamouse-coffee-table-book\">at NDM Express</a>. NDM Express is recommended if you have credit card issues at Arkhaven. We’re doing this for the benefit of those who missed the campaign for one week only and features the first 100 episodes of the Arkhaven comic as well as the nine episodes of the original black-and-white comic drawn by the original illustrator.</p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-68057\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"199\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" src=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-11.png\" srcset=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-11.png 512w, https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-11-300x117.png 300w\" width=\"512\"/></figure></div><p>Each episode features large panels and stretches across two pages, which is why although the coffee table book is 222 pages, the content is exactly the same as the 115-page hardcovers and paperbacks that have already shipped out to all of the backers, including the essays by Vox and Lacey.
