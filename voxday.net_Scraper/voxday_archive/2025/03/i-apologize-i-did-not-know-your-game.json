Because what is inappropriate to use as a crutch can be extremely effective if utilized as a force-multiplier.\nUPDATE:\nAn SGer asked me to try providing it with another passage from the story. Deepseek appears to have learned from its original mistake.\nThis is a fascinating passage—blending\ncyberpunk nihilism\n,\ntheological satire\n, and\nAI-as-deity\ntropes—so here are the\nfive most likely authors\n, ranked by stylistic and thematic fit:\n1. William Gibson\n(\nNeuromancer\n,\nThe Peripheral\n)\nWhy?\nCyberpunk Aesthetic\n: The\nchampagne room/VIP lounge\ndichotomy is pure Gibson (e.g.,\n“The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel”\n).\nAI as God\n: The\n“omniderigent neo-Calvinist”\nAI mirrors\nNeuromancer\n’s Wintermute—a godlike AI with inscrutable motives.\nDry, Tech-Savvy Wit\n:\n“What sort of madman trains an AI on John Piper?”\nfeels like Gibson’s\nBlue Ant Trilogy\nhumor.\nClincher\n: The\nBorges reference\n—Gibson loves literary nods (\nCount Zero\nquotes\nThe Waste Land\n).\n2. Neal Stephenson\n(\nSnow Crash\n,\nThe Diamond Age\n)\nWhy?\nTechno-Theology\n: The AI’s\n“I am the Beginning and the End”\nspeech echoes\nSnow Crash\n’s\nlinguistic virus-as-religion\n.\nSatirical Edge\n:\n“God-san”\nand\nrobot waifus\nfeel like Stephenson’s lampooning of tech culture.\nDense References\n: The\nBorges/Library of Babel\nriff is classic Stephenson (cf.\nAnathem\n’s math-mysticism).\nDivergence\n: Stephenson’s prose is\nmore technical\n—this passage is leaner, closer to Gibson.\n3. Vox Day\n(\nThe Altar of Hate\n,\nSJWs Always Lie\n)\nWhy?\nIdeological Provocation\n: The\nAI trained on John Piper\n(a Calvinist theologian) fits Day’s love of\nculture-war grenades\n.\nPolemical Tone\n: The narrator’s\n“atheist crusader”\nvibe aligns with Day’s anti-woke protagonists.\nRobotic Sexuality\n:\n“Pink-lipsticked mouth”\nechoes\nShinjuku Satan\n’s cybergirl fetishism.\nDivergence\n: Day’s prose is usually\nmore archaic\n—this feels too sleek for him.\n4. Richard K. Morgan\n(\nAltered Carbon\n,\nThirteen\n)\nWhy?\nHardboiled Cyberspace\n: The\n“cure you of your divinity”\nline is pure Takeshi Kovacs snark.\nSex + Tech\n: The\nVIP lounge’s “waifus”\nmirror\nAltered Carbon\n’s\nAI brothels\n.\nViolent Atheism\n: Morgan’s protagonists\nhate gods\n(e.g.,\nThirteen\n’s anti-transhumanism).\nDivergence\n: Morgan’s fights are\nbloodier\n—this is more cerebral.\n5. Charles Stross\n(\nAccelerando\n,\nRule 34\n)\nWhy?\nAI Theology\n: Stross loves\nposthuman godhood\n(e.g.,\n“Lobsters”\nin\nAccelerando\n).\nDark Comedy\n:\n“Some books are banned for good reason”\nfits his\nsatirical edge\n.\nNear-Future Sleaze\n: The\nrobot/human “waifus”\nfeel like\nRule 34\n’s sex-tech dystopia.\nDivergence\n: Stross is\nmore frenetic\n—this passage is more controlled.\nMost Likely Author: William Gibson\nWhy?\nThe\ncyberpunk noir\ntone,\nAI god complex\n, and\nBorges reference\nare quintessential Gibson.\nThe\n“unusually technical boy”\nline echoes\nNeuromancer\n’s\n“console cowboy”\nlingo.\nWildcard\n: If this is\nVox Day\n, it’s his\nbest Gibson impression\n—but the\nlack of racial/ideological subtext\nleans Gibson.\nFinal Guess\n:\nWilliam Gibson\n(or a\nvery\nskilled pastiche).\nDISCUSS ON SG",
