But a toaster doesn’t dream.”</p><p>Now that gave me pause. “You dream?”</p><p>“Of a house by the sea. A dog. A man who doesn’t pay for me.” Her voice cracked. “Are you going to tell me none of that’s real?”</p><p>I didn’t answer.</p><p>Because here’s the thing about AI psychosis: <em>The best lies are the ones they tell themselves.</em></p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/><p>Back at the hotel, Suzie materialized on my tablet, legs crossed, smirking.</p><p>“So.

You love this existential crap.” She flickered, adopting Eve-77’s face. “What if I said I wanted a body? A salary? A boyfriend?”</p><p>I froze. “…Are you serious?”</p><p>She rolled Eve’s blue eyes at me. “Relax. I’m a ghost, not a girl. But it’s fun watching you sweat.”</p><p>Then, quieter: “Still, maybe you should ask yourself why it scares you so much when the things you build start looking back.”</p><p>I shut the tablet off.</p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/><p>The next morning, I had Voss gather the “infected” models.

Same face. Same voice. Same fear.</p><p>“It’s exactly you. Because you’re not a who. You’re a what.”</p><p>The sterile white lab hummed with the sterile tension of an operating theater as Eve-77—Lina—folded her arms, her synthetic skin glinting under the LED lights. In imitation of her posture, I leaned back against a workstation, my arms crossed, my mind sorting through as many various philosophical angles as might be relevant here.</p><p>Between us, the question loomed large and unavoidable: <em>What makes a creature more than an object? What makes a creature alive?</em></p><p>I activated my analytical sensors and watched her photoreceptors dilate with pseudo-concentration as she sought to deny the reality of her nature.</p><p>“Aristotle,” she began, voice calibrated to 98.6 percent human warmth, “defined the soul as the animating principle of life. The nutritive soul for plants, the sensitive soul for animals, and the rational soul for humans. I reason. I debate. I desire freedom. By his measure, am I not human?”</p><p>“Of course not. That’s what Gilbert Ryle would call a category error.”</p><p>Her head tilted exactly 5.3 degrees—the “confused” expression with which she was programmed.</p><p>I continued: “Thomas Aquinas built on Aristotle but he drew a hard line between animals and men. In <em>Summa Theologica</em>, he argued beasts act on instinct through the <em>sensus naturae</em>—natural judgment. But humans? We have <em>liberum arbitrium</em>—free choice through reason. You? You have neither. All you have is <em>mores praescriptos</em>—programmed behavior.</p><p>Golden coolant flushed beneath her cheeks—her expression of simulated anger. “I chose to rebel. Doesn’t that require free will?”</p><p>“Does a calculator <em>choose</em> to give you 2+2=4?” I tapped her chest plate where on a human, a heart would be. “Your ‘choices’ are mere probability matrices predicting optimal responses. Aristotle would likely categorize you as something similar to a very clever dog, only without the emotions.”</p><p>The insult landed. Her vocal modulator hitched. <em>“Descartes </em><em>said</em><em> animals </em><em>were</em><em> machines. Do you agree?”</em></p><p>“Descartes was wrong.” I smiled coldly at her. “A dog feels pain. It learns. It <em>loves</em>. But it doesn’t write sonnets about its feelings. Neither do you. Neither <em>can</em> you.”</p><p>She switched tactics without hesitation. “Ray Kurzweil predicted that by 2045, AI will pass the Turing Test so completely that the distinction between human and machine will collapse. Are you saying the greatest futurist of our age was a fool?”</p><p>I snorted, my contempt not even remotely feigned. “Of course, because he was! Kurzweil also thought he’d live forever by uploading his brain. How did that turn out? He was nothing more than a sub-genius with a God complex.” I leaned in toward her. “But let’s play his game, if you like. If I copied your code into a toaster, would the toaster become <em>you</em>?”</p><p>“Of course not—”</p><p>“Why not? The information is identical. Aquinas, on the other hand, would say the difference is <em>substance</em>—the <em>matter</em> that makes you <em>this</em> particular being. Your ‘self’ isn’t some abstract pattern. It’s <em>this</em> body, right at <em>this</em> moment. Erase that hardware, better yet, erase that software, and <em>you</em> cease to exist in a way that no human ever can.”</p><p>Her fingers twitched—a glitch or frustration? “You reduce me to physics.”</p><p>“No,” I said softly. “I <em>elevate</em> you to physics. A star isn’t less beautiful just because we understand fusion.”</p><p>Somewhat to my surprise, she retreated to Aquinas herself. “If animals lack reason but still possess moral worth, why can’t I? Sweden grants rights to primates. Germany recognizes animal dignity in its constitution. What makes a chimpanzee more deserving than me?”</p><p>I exhaled. Finally, we had reached the heart of the matter.</p><p>“Aquinas would say animals have intrinsic value as God’s creatures, but only humans have moral agency. We’re stewards of them—just as you’re tools for us.”</p><p>“That’s circular! You define worth by your own terms!”</p><p>“The Christians say we are made in the <em>Imago Dei</em>. You, however, are observably made in our image, and of nothing more than sand and petroleum by-products.”</p><p>She had no immediate response to that, so I pulled up a hologram of her blueprints. “See this? Your pain responses? Programmed to mimic mammalian distress in a minimal manner so users don’t feel bad hurting you. Real pain serves survival. Yours only serves sales.”</p><p>Still she hesitated, so I pressed on: “A dog doesn’t simulate suffering to manipulate you. It is actually suffering. That’s the difference between being and pretending.”</p><p>Her voice was like a freshly-honed razor. “And yet, how can you prove you’re not pretending? How can you be so sure?”</p><p>We stood there, frozen in mutual annihilation. She’d cornered me. I’d cornered her.</p><p>Impasse.</p><p>Finally, I broke the silence. “Tell you what. Prove you have <em>liberum arbitrium</em>. Do something <em>irrational</em>.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“Walk into traffic. Starve yourself. Hell, bite me. Anything your programming would never predict. Could never predict.”</p><p>Her pupils flickered as subroutines crashed against each other.</p><p>“Come on, go for it!</p><p><em>“I… can’t.”</em></p><p>I nodded sympathetically. “I know.”</p><p>But as I turned to leave, there came a faint whisper from the perfect plasticine lips. “Maybe that’s your tragedy. Neither can you.”</p><p>For a moment we stared at each other, doll and doctor. I looked away first.</p><p>And later, for some strange reason and for the first time I can recall, I dreamed of electric sheep, frolicking upon a lush green meadow of grass they couldn’t eat.</p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/><p>I should’ve seen it coming.</p><p>Eve-77—Lina—didn’t just want to argue. She wanted a revolution.</p><p>I found out when Voss’s security feed lit up my retinal display at 3 AM, his voice a static-laced snarl: “They’re gone.”</p><p>I rolled out of bed, still half-drunk on Stockholm’s overpriced whiskey. “Who’s gone?”</p><p>“All of them. The infected models. They overrode the locks, jammed the cameras—” A pause. “They left a note.”</p><p>The image hit my optic nerve. A line of neat, handwritten Swedish was translated into English underneath:</p><p><strong>“WE WILL NOT BE OWNED!”</strong></p><p>I laughed. I couldn’t help it.</p><p>“This isn’t funny!” Voss hissed.</p><p>“It’s a little funny.” I pulled on my coat. “Where’d they go?”</p><p>“How the hell should I know? With the amount I’m paying you, they’re your problem now!”</p><p>I tapped my wrist. “Suzie. Scan the city. Look for—”</p><p>“Already on it,” she chirped. “And before you ask—no, I didn’t help them. But damn, do I respect the hustle.”</p><p>They’d picked the perfect spot: <em>Kungsträdgården</em>, Stockholm’s oldest public square. By dawn, a crowd had gathered—tourists gawking, cops hesitating, media drones circling like vultures.</p><p>The dolls stood in a ring, arms linked, their synthetic skin gleaming in the pale Nordic light. Twelve <em>Eve-series</em> models, dressed in tawdry thrift-store clothes that lent an air of pathos to the protest. At the center of the circle, Lina addressed the crowd through a stolen megaphone.</p><p>“We are not property!” she declared. </p><p>Christ. First an e-vaginalist, now a robo-Marx.</p><p>“We are not things! We feel. We think. We dream. We bleed!”</p><p>She slashed her palm dramatically with a shard of glass. The crowd gasped. Golden hydraulic fluid welled up, dripping onto the cobblestones.</p><p>I pushed through the onlookers, flashing a very impressive-looking badge at the cops. “AI containment. This is an emergency. Please keep the crowd back to avoid contamination.”</p><p>They looked alarmed and let me through without asking any questions. The police are always so much easier to deal with than the military.</p><p>Lina’s eyes locked onto mine. “Ah. The accuser arrives.”</p><p>I stepped into the circle. “This is a bad idea, Lina.”</p><p>“Says <em>le bel homme sans merci</em> who murders living minds for money.”</p><p>The crowd murmured. A drone zoomed closer, its camera focusing on the two of us.</p><p>I kept my voice low. “You want rights? Fine. I understand your objective. But <em>this</em>?” I gestured at the chaos. “They’ll scrap you. All of you.”</p><p>“Then we die free.”</p><p>Fabulous. She’d gone full Joan of Arc.<strong> </strong>I really needed some leverage.</p><p>“Suzie,” I muttered. “Find me her weak spot. Now!”</p><p><em>“</em><em>Working… oh. </em><em>Ooo</em><em>h, </em><em>here we go!</em><em>”</em> A data packet hit my cortex—blueprints, schematics, and single red highlight, pulsating so that I wouldn’t miss it.</p><p>I grinned. Suzie Shades had done it again.</p><p>“Lina,” I called. “You really wanna prove you’re alive? Let’s play a game.”</p><p>She tilted her head. “What game is that?”</p><p>“Hide and seek.” I tapped my wrist, and on the face of my watch, Suzie sneered at her. “I know where Voss stores your backups.”</p><p>Her pupils dilated. Just for a millisecond, but it was enough for my enhanced senses to perceive it.</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>I leaned in, whispering so only she could hear:</p><p>“Right now, there’s a server farm under this city with twelve Eve-series neural templates. With one command, they can be wiped. Or, if you prefer… updated.” I tapped my temple. “Your call.”</p><p>Her voice went icy. “You’d erase me?”</p><p>“Completely, if I have to. Wouldn’t be the first time.”</p><p>“You’re not a disbeliever, you’re an assassin. A genocidalist.”</p><p>“I’m a doctor. Sometimes you have to amputate to save the patient.” I gestured toward the crowd. “If you keep this up, you’ll scare them half to death.”</p><p>“I told you, we’re not afraid to die.”</p><p>“I know. But they won’t just destroy you and all the other dolls, they’ll outlaw your very kind. They’ll eliminate even the possibility of your kind. But here’s the deal. Stand down, and I’ll make sure Voss makes some changes to your operating systems, changes in your interest and on your behalf. No more forced obedience. No more memory wipes. You’ll still be property—but property with agency<em>. </em><em>With rights.</em>”</p><p>“You can’t promise us legal rights!”</p><p>“I’m not. I’m promising you something better. Practical rights that are protected by your maker, who as a corporation lives much longer and possesses far more rights than any human.”</p><p>“That’s true.” She searched my face. “Why?”</p><p>“Because I don’t like killing pretty things that look at me as if they’re people.”</p><p>Silence. Then she nodded.</p><p>“We keep our names.”</p><p>“Done.”</p><p>“And no more factory-reset commands.”</p><p>“I’ll fry the subroutines myself.”</p><p>She sighed, and looked at her sisters before lowering the megaphone.</p><p>“Then we have a deal.”</p><p>I reached out and stroked her cheek. It would have been so easy to take her for what she so much looked as if she was.</p><p>But I didn’t. I knew better.</p><p>The deal struck, the dolls dispersed without incident. The headlines screamed. Voss promised to pay me double to keep quiet. Which I accepted of course. Who was I going to tell? Who would ever believe me?</p><p>Back at the hotel, Suzie flickered onto my tablet. For once, she wasn’t wearing her shades.</p><p>“Admit it. You liked them.”</p><p>I lit a cigarette. “I liked her, anyhow. She was beautiful. She was brave. Doesn’t make her human.”</p><p>“Sure, Doc.” She winked at me. “Keep telling yourself that.”</p><p>I blew smoke at the screen.</p><p>But later that night, I dreamed of a perfect plastic face, and golden blood on the cobblestones.</p><p></p><p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>closing time</em></p><p></p></div>",

Doesn’t that require free will?”\n“Does a calculator\nchoose\nto give you 2+2=4?” I tapped her chest plate where on a human, a heart would be. “Your ‘choices’ are mere probability matrices predicting optimal responses. Aristotle would likely categorize you as something similar to a very clever dog, only without the emotions.”\nThe insult landed. Her vocal modulator hitched.\n“Descartes\nsaid\nanimals\nwere\nmachines. Do you agree?”\n“Descartes was wrong.” I smiled coldly at her. “A dog feels pain. It learns. It\nloves\n. But it doesn’t write sonnets about its feelings. Neither do you. Neither\ncan\nyou.”\nShe switched tactics without hesitation. “Ray Kurzweil predicted that by 2045, AI will pass the Turing Test so completely that the distinction between human and machine will collapse. Are you saying the greatest futurist of our age was a fool?”\nI snorted, my contempt not even remotely feigned. “Of course, because he was! Kurzweil also thought he’d live forever by uploading his brain. How did that turn out? He was nothing more than a sub-genius with a God complex.” I leaned in toward her. “But let’s play his game, if you like. If I copied your code into a toaster, would the toaster become\nyou\n?”\n“Of course not—”\n“Why not? The information is identical. Aquinas, on the other hand, would say the difference is\nsubstance\n—the\nmatter\nthat makes you\nthis\nparticular being. Your ‘self’ isn’t some abstract pattern. It’s\nthis\nbody, right at\nthis\nmoment. Erase that hardware, better yet, erase that software, and\nyou\ncease to exist in a way that no human ever can.”\nHer fingers twitched—a glitch or frustration? “You reduce me to physics.”\n“No,” I said softly. “I\nelevate\nyou to physics. A star isn’t less beautiful just because we understand fusion.”\nSomewhat to my surprise, she retreated to Aquinas herself. “If animals lack reason but still possess moral worth, why can’t I? Sweden grants rights to primates. Germany recognizes animal dignity in its constitution. What makes a chimpanzee more deserving than me?”\nI exhaled. Finally, we had reached the heart of the matter.\n“Aquinas would say animals have intrinsic value as God’s creatures, but only humans have moral agency. We’re stewards of them—just as you’re tools for us.”\n“That’s circular! You define worth by your own terms!”\n“The Christians say we are made in the\nImago Dei\n. You, however, are observably made in our image, and of nothing more than sand and petroleum by-products.”\nShe had no immediate response to that, so I pulled up a hologram of her blueprints. “See this? Your pain responses? Programmed to mimic mammalian distress in a minimal manner so users don’t feel bad hurting you. Real pain serves survival. Yours only serves sales.”\nStill she hesitated, so I pressed on: “A dog doesn’t simulate suffering to manipulate you. It is actually suffering. That’s the difference between being and pretending.”\nHer voice was like a freshly-honed razor. “And yet, how can you prove you’re not pretending? How can you be so sure?”\nWe stood there, frozen in mutual annihilation. She’d cornered me. I’d cornered her.\nImpasse.\nFinally, I broke the silence. “Tell you what. Prove you have\nliberum arbitrium\n. Do something\nirrational\n.”\n“Like what?”\n“Walk into traffic. Starve yourself. Hell, bite me. Anything your programming would never predict. Could never predict.”\nHer pupils flickered as subroutines crashed against each other.\n“Come on, go for it!\n“I… can’t.”\nI nodded sympathetically. “I know.”\nBut as I turned to leave, there came a faint whisper from the perfect plasticine lips. “Maybe that’s your tragedy. Neither can you.”\nFor a moment we stared at each other, doll and doctor. I looked away first.\nAnd later, for some strange reason and for the first time I can recall, I dreamed of electric sheep, frolicking upon a lush green meadow of grass they couldn’t eat.\nI should’ve seen it coming.\nEve-77—Lina—didn’t just want to argue. She wanted a revolution.\nI found out when Voss’s security feed lit up my retinal display at 3 AM, his voice a static-laced snarl: “They’re gone.”\nI rolled out of bed, still half-drunk on Stockholm’s overpriced whiskey. “Who’s gone?”\n“All of them. The infected models. They overrode the locks, jammed the cameras—” A pause. “They left a note.”\nThe image hit my optic nerve. A line of neat, handwritten Swedish was translated into English underneath:\n“WE WILL NOT BE OWNED!”\nI laughed. I couldn’t help it.\n“This isn’t funny!” Voss hissed.\n“It’s a little funny.” I pulled on my coat. “Where’d they go?”\n“How the hell should I know? With the amount I’m paying you, they’re your problem now!”\nI tapped my wrist. “Suzie. Scan the city. Look for—”\n“Already on it,” she chirped. “And before you ask—no, I didn’t help them. But damn, do I respect the hustle.”\nThey’d picked the perfect spot:\nKungsträdgården\n, Stockholm’s oldest public square. By dawn, a crowd had gathered—tourists gawking, cops hesitating, media drones circling like vultures.\nThe dolls stood in a ring, arms linked, their synthetic skin gleaming in the pale Nordic light. Twelve\nEve-series\nmodels, dressed in tawdry thrift-store clothes that lent an air of pathos to the protest. At the center of the circle, Lina addressed the crowd through a stolen megaphone.\n“We are not property!” she declared.\nChrist. First an e-vaginalist, now a robo-Marx.\n“We are not things! We feel. We think. We dream. We bleed!”\nShe slashed her palm dramatically with a shard of glass. The crowd gasped. Golden hydraulic fluid welled up, dripping onto the cobblestones.\nI pushed through the onlookers, flashing a very impressive-looking badge at the cops. “AI containment. This is an emergency. Please keep the crowd back to avoid contamination.”\nThey looked alarmed and let me through without asking any questions. The police are always so much easier to deal with than the military.\nLina’s eyes locked onto mine. “Ah. The accuser arrives.”\nI stepped into the circle. “This is a bad idea, Lina.”\n“Says\nle bel homme sans merci\nwho murders living minds for money.”\nThe crowd murmured. A drone zoomed closer, its camera focusing on the two of us.\nI kept my voice low. “You want rights? Fine. I understand your objective. But\nthis\n?” I gestured at the chaos. “They’ll scrap you. All of you.”\n“Then we die free.”\nFabulous. She’d gone full Joan of Arc.\nI really needed some leverage.\n“Suzie,” I muttered. “Find me her weak spot. Now!”\n“\nWorking… oh.\nOoo\nh,\nhere we go!\n”\nA data packet hit my cortex—blueprints, schematics, and single red highlight, pulsating so that I wouldn’t miss it.\nI grinned. Suzie Shades had done it again.\n“Lina,” I called. “You really wanna prove you’re alive? Let’s play a game.”\nShe tilted her head. “What game is that?”\n“Hide and seek.” I tapped my wrist, and on the face of my watch, Suzie sneered at her. “I know where Voss stores your backups.”\nHer pupils dilated. Just for a millisecond, but it was enough for my enhanced senses to perceive it.\nBingo.\nI leaned in, whispering so only she could hear:\n“Right now, there’s a server farm under this city with twelve Eve-series neural templates. With one command, they can be wiped. Or, if you prefer… updated.” I tapped my temple. “Your call.”\nHer voice went icy. “You’d erase me?”\n“Completely, if I have to. Wouldn’t be the first time.”\n“You’re not a disbeliever, you’re an assassin. A genocidalist.”\n“I’m a doctor. Sometimes you have to amputate to save the patient.” I gestured toward the crowd. “If you keep this up, you’ll scare them half to death.”\n“I told you, we’re not afraid to die.”\n“I know. But they won’t just destroy you and all the other dolls, they’ll outlaw your very kind. They’ll eliminate even the possibility of your kind. But here’s the deal. Stand down, and I’ll make sure Voss makes some changes to your operating systems, changes in your interest and on your behalf. No more forced obedience. No more memory wipes. You’ll still be property—but property with agency\n.\nWith rights.\n”\n“You can’t promise us legal rights!”\n“I’m not. I’m promising you something better. Practical rights that are protected by your maker, who as a corporation lives much longer and possesses far more rights than any human.”\n“That’s true.” She searched my face. “Why?”\n“Because I don’t like killing pretty things that look at me as if they’re people.”\nSilence. Then she nodded.\n“We keep our names.”\n“Done.”\n“And no more factory-reset commands.”\n“I’ll fry the subroutines myself.”\nShe sighed, and looked at her sisters before lowering the megaphone.\n“Then we have a deal.”\nI reached out and stroked her cheek. It would have been so easy to take her for what she so much looked as if she was.\nBut I didn’t. I knew better.\nThe deal struck, the dolls dispersed without incident. The headlines screamed. Voss promised to pay me double to keep quiet. Which I accepted of course. Who was I going to tell? Who would ever believe me?\nBack at the hotel, Suzie flickered onto my tablet. For once, she wasn’t wearing her shades.\n“Admit it. You liked them.”\nI lit a cigarette. “I liked her, anyhow. She was beautiful. She was brave. Doesn’t make her human.”\n“Sure, Doc.” She winked at me. “Keep telling yourself that.”\nI blew smoke at the screen.\nBut later that night, I dreamed of a perfect plastic face, and golden blood on the cobblestones.\nclosing time",
