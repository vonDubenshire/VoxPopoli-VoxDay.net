How quickly does that allele spread?</p><p>For E. coli bacteria, the answer is straightforward. Bacteria reproduce by binary fission. When a generation reproduces, the parents are gone—consumed in the act of creating offspring. There is no overlap. Kimura’s discrete-generation model was built for exactly this situation.</p><p>Now consider red foxes. A fox might live 5 years in the wild and reproduce in multiple seasons. At any given time, the population contains juveniles, young adults, prime breeders, and older individuals—all competing, all contributing genes. When this year’s pups are born, last year’s pups are still around. So are their parents. The gene pool churns rather than resets.</p><p>Let’s model what happens over 100 years with the same selection coefficient (s = 0.05), starting from 1% frequency:</p><figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Species</strong></td><td><strong>Nominal Generations</strong></td><td><strong>Effective Generations</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Frequency</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>E. coli (Kimura d = 1.0)</td><td>876,000</td><td>876,000</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Fox (d = 0.60)</td><td>50</td><td>30</td><td>13.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Fox (Kimura d = 1.0)</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>26.4%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The difference is immediately observable. If we apply Kimura’s model to foxes (assuming d = 1.0), we predict the allele will reach 26.4 percent after 100 years. But if foxes have 60 percent generational turnover—a reasonable estimate for a mammal with 5-year lifespan and multi-year reproduction—the Bio-Cycle model predicts only 13.8 percent. The path to mutational fixation is significantly slowed.</p><p>This isn’t a refutation of Kimura’s model. It is merely recognizing when his generational assumptions apply and when they don’t. For bacteria, d = 1.0 is correct. For foxes, d &lt; 1.0. For humans, with our even longer lifespans and extended reproduction, d should be lower still. The question is: what is the correct value?</p><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Test 2: Lactase Persistence in Europeans</h4><p>Ancient DNA gives us something unprecedented: direct observations of allele frequencies through time. We can watch evolution happen and measure how fast alleles actually spread, the consider which model best matches the way reality played out.</p><p>Lactase persistence—the ability to digest milk sugar into adulthood—is the textbook example of recent human evolution. The persistence allele was virtually absent in early Neolithic Europeans 6,000 years ago (less than 1 percent frequency). Today, about 75 percent of Northern Europeans carry it. Researchers estimate the selection coefficient at s = 0.04–0.10, driven by the ~500 extra calories per day available from milk.</p><p>Using the midpoint (s = 0.05), what does each model predict?</p><figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Model</strong></td><td><strong>Final Frequency</strong></td><td><strong>Error</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Actual (observed)</strong></td><td><strong>75%</strong></td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Kimura (d = 1.0)</td><td>99.9%</td><td>+24.9 percentage points</td></tr><tr><td>Bio-Cycle (d = 0.45)</td><td>67.4%</td><td>−7.6 percentage points</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Kimura predicts the allele should have reached near-fixation. It hasn’t. The Bio-Cycle model, with d = 0.45, predicts 67.4 percent—within 8 percentage points of the observed frequency. That’s a 69 percent reduction in prediction error.</p><p>Why d = 0.45? In Neolithic populations, average lifespan was 35–40 years. People reproduced between ages 15 and 30. At any given time, 2–3 generations were alive simultaneously. A 45 percent turnover rate per nominal generation is consistent with these demographics.</p><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Test 3: SLC45A2 and Skin Pigmentation</h4><p>Light skin pigmentation in Europeans evolved under strong selection for vitamin D synthesis at higher latitudes. SLC45A2 is one of the major genes involved. Ancient DNA from Ukraine shows the “light skin” allele was at 43 percent frequency roughly 4,000 years ago. Today it’s at 97 percent.
