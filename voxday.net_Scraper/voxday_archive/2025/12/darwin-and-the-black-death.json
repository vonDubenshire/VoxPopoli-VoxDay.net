Another very effective one is the Black Death, which left an observable mark on the genes of the descendants of those Europeans who survived it.\nThe CCR5-delta32 mutation is a 32-base-pair deletion in the CCR5 gene that, among other effects, confers significant resistance to HIV infection. This mutation is found almost exclusively in European populations, where it currently exists in approximately 10% of the population. Its geographic distribution and the nature of the selective pressure it confers have led scientific researchers to propose that it was positively selected during the Black Death pandemic of 1347-1351.\nFor our purposes, the precise historical cause of the mutation’s selection is less important than the observed rate of its historical propagation.
