Of course, since the value of everything will then be a fixed quantity, there would no longer be any such thing as an upwardly mobile middle class either.

The amount of gold increases very slowly, as opposed to the massive inflationary increases in the money supply which are revealed in the national debt and the M3 money supply – not the fraudulent CPI – and are inevitable in any paper money system.  Paper money always fails and becomes worthless in the end, the only question is when the end will arrive.  The important thing about gold – or an alternative metal – is that it prevents the steady increase in central government power created by this inevitable inflation.  The notion that there would be no middle class without inflation is bizarre – the value point is irrelevant, as above – and the middle class itself developed prior to the establishment of the current fiat regime.  In fact, the position of the middle class has been greatly weakened, as only the addition of a second income has allowed most middle class households to remain where they were fifty years ago.  (There’s a good study on this somewhere, I’ll try to find it.  Basically, the increase in taxes which stem from inflation eat up the entire second income so the disposable income has remained approximately the same.  Of course, easy debt has allowed many to live beyond their means, but at a price.)</p><p>In short, gold is the ultimate weapon of financial freedom and an important foundation of economic and political freedom as well.  The USA has profited greatly by suckering billions of dollars daily out of the poor fools buying our debt, but eventually foreigners will wake up to the fact that they’ve been robbed by the unconscionable counterfeiting.
