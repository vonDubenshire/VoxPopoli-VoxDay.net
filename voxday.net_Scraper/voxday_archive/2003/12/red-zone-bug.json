When the computer has the ball inside the five-yard line, a play-action call will result in the quarterback faking the handoff to the running back, then immediately throwing the ball <em>while he is still facing backward</em>.  This, of course, is a fumble, and since the defense is usually rushing aggressively, will tend to result in the ball being scooped up and returned for a defensive touchdown.</p><p>I thought it was just an anomaly when it happened the first time a few weeks ago, but when it happened again today from a similar formation, I realized it was a bug.  The quarterback is obviously programmed to throw the ball before he has time to turn around.  A nice 14-point turnaround there.</p></div>",
