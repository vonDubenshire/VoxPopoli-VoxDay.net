Trying to bring Rush Limbaugh into it only shows that you’re not equipped to even begin understanding the piece.</p><p>4)  Get your facts straight.  I will not waste any time responding to anyone who is so ignorant as to equate the Spanish Inquisition (6,000 deaths in 356 years) with the National Socialist’s Holocaust (12 million in 11 years).  This does not make me a coward, it makes you an ignoramus unworthy of debate.  Most wars are not caused by religion.  Did the significance of the Seneca quote escape you?  Read the Chronicles of the Assyrian Kings or Chinese history if you think war and religion are synonymous.  War is about power, plain and simple.  Religion, most of the time, is only the excuse.

Riding on an airplane is not an act of faith.  Arguing that the Earth is X years old – 6,000 or 6 billion, is.  Remember, scientists used to say that the Hittites and Assyrians didn’t exist either.
