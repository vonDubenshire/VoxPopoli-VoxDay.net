No one ever said the way was easy, quite the contrary, in fact.  But we have hope.  George Washington almost never won a battle as an American general, but he won the war because he stubbornly and faithfully persevered.  There is no secret, only a simple answer.  When you get knocked down, get up again.  Once you have decided to get back up again no matter how often you are knocked down, you have already won; you cannot be defeated.  Some do it with saintly grace, others with snarling defiance.  Hold to the truth regardless.</p><p>Your country is not your government.  You can love the one and despise the other.  Nor do you need to approve of something to love it, indeed, when we love something it is often the very flaws that make it unique that we come to love the most.  I love the friendly, unpretentious savagery of my countrymen, the singular combination of unsophisticated good nature and lethal barbarism that makes them both amusing companions and fearsome enemies.  It is this very trait that gives me hope that one day America will wake up, and turn with a vengeance on those who have tried, like Lilliputians with Gulliver, to bind her down that she might be destroyed.</p><p>But even if this is not the case and America succumbs to the eroding forces of evil, I will feel more encouraged with every satanic step towards global tyranny, implanted GPS tracking and total financial monitoring.  Because we already know from the Revelation that it must get worse before it will get better, and even if our petty efforts are in vain, those of the one we serve and worship will not be.  We may be the Spartans of our day, but the glory of our cause will long outlast Thermopylae.</p></div>",
