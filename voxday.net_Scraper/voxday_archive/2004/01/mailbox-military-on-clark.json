Not for a second.  The man is far too vain and ambitious to willingly play the patsy, and he’s intelligent enough to see through their generally rather obvious machinations.  Contrary to what people believe, neither Bill nor Hillary are especially intelligent – from what I understand, Clark is at least a level up on both of them.  This would not be unusual.  I happen to know that at least one member of Bill Clinton’s Joint Chiefs – not Wesley Clark – had an IQ that exceeded his 137 by almost 40 points.</p></div>",
