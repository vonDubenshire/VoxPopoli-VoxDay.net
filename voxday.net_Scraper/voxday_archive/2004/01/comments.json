The comments don’t show up unless you go out of your way to read them, and I can nuke individual ones anyhow.

I don’t promise that I will, but I’m basically just scanning the comments to make sure that no one is abusing the forum.  I’m not policing it for agreement with my positions, only for basic civility and, preferably, a modicum of sense.</p></div>",
