In the battle of the smooched buttocks, Mike Sherman got cute and Brett Favre got stupid and the Packers gave the game away.  Ahman Green got his 150 yards, Ralph Wiley notwithstanding, which makes the two third-and-short passes in Eagle’s territory all the more bewildering.  Incomplete – punt, incomplete – punt.

Gee, a field goal in any of those possessions would have come in handy, don’t you think?</p><p>Was I impressed by Donovan McNabb – sure, he never quit.  The scramble-and-throw to Pinkston was fantastic.  But do I think he’s a superstar quarterback now?  Never.  If he rushes for 100, throws for 250 and no interceptions against Carolina’s defense, then I’ll consider it.</p><p>Great games, all told.   Nothing like the NFL.
