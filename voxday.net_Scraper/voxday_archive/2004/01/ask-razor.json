IRS Commissioner Mark Everson said the agency is taking extra steps to make sure IRS employees are following the law.  “The multistep initiative will include a new review of tax behavior of IRS employees, a deeper IRS compliance and auditing effort for employees and an expanded education and outreach effort inside the agency,” the IRS said.
