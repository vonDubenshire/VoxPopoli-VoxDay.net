A friend of mine was the state champion gymnast and a top 100 meter sprinter in 9th grade; by our senior year she was no longer competing in gymnastics and didn’t finish in the medals in the conference championship, let alone the regional meet.  Her times actually slowed about half a second, while in that same period, my 100 meter time dropped by almost three seconds.

But it’s hard not to forget how Martina Hingis’ career is over and done at an age when many great male champions had yet to win their first major.  This doesn’t take anything away from Miss Wie’s accomplishments now, but it seems odd to completely ignore history and physiology in discussing the probable future.</p></div>",
