Since the current US rate is high by both world and historical standards, estimating the 20th century global murder rate by dividing the US rate by 4 seemed a reasonable educated guess, which gives 1.64 per 100,000, or 0.000016379.</br></br></p><p>It’s hard to know how precisely how many people lived in the 20th century, but looking at a number of demographic sites indicated that the number was somewhere around 18 billion people on the high end.

The problem likely stems from not comparing apples to apples, by comparing a percentage calculated from a total to an annual rate.

(19,000 x 100) x (6 billion / 290 million) = a maximum 39,310,394 murders in the 20th century.
