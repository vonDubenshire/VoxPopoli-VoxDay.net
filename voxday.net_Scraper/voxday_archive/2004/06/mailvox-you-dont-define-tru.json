Your friend wants to hang onto the parts he likes, and ignore the parts he doesn’t.  That’s absurd.  If he wants to reject the whole thing, that’s fine, he should reject it all and indulge himself in wine, women and song for he only has a few short decades before his consciousness is obliterated into nothing.

He claims to be just – everyone has sinned and is therefore damned.  But He is also merciful – He offers a Way out to all.  You don’t have to take it, but if you don’t, then be prepared to suffer the consequences.  The unbeliever accepts this cheerfully because he rejects the totality.  It is only the wishy-washy half-believer who suffers mental turmoil, because he cannot commit either way.  But what he wants or what he thinks should be is as utterly irrelevant to the question of the existence of Hell as it is to the existence of Toledo.</p><p>It always amazes me that people don’t understand the parable of the wheat and the chaff.  If you can’t believe or refuse to bow down before God’s Son, then you are essentially worthless in God’s eyes, you have failed in the purpose for which you were created and you will be tossed aside as useless trash.
