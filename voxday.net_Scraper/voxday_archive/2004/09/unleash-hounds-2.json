Bad!\nDear Ms Malkin,\nAs you did not respond substantively to any of the points I raised in my column or my first email to you, I am addressing the following questions directly to you.\n1. I have asserted that there was no reasonable risk of invasion.\nThis opinion is supported by modern military experts. You have\nwritten that “the risk of full-scale invasion was low”. Did this\n“low” risk alone justify the internment?\n2. Was the number of troops stationed in California, Oregon and\nWashington in February 1942 sufficient to deal with Japan’s\ntrans-Pacific troop transport capacity?\n3. The production figures for 1940 through 1945 show a significant\ndelta between the United States and Japan. Could sabotage have\naccounted for enough damage to, as you suggest, potentially\ncripple the war effort, and what percentage of lost production\nwould you describe as “crippling”?\n4. Did this potential risk of sabotage alone justify the\ninternment?\n5. Was the potential for cumulative damage from sabotage and spot\nraids on the West Coast greater or less than the cumulative\ndamage to Germany wrought by the Allied bombing campaign of\nGermany in 1943 and 1944?\n6. 160 planes were destroyed at Pearl Harbor. Based on 1940-41\nproduction figures, how long did it take to replace those planes\nand how many planes were left to American forces?\n7. Were any subsequent “spot raids” likely to cause more or less\ndamage than Pearl Harbor?\n8. Considering that the Japanese lost 29 planes in the Pearl Harbor\nattack, what is the probable number of spot raids they could\nhave made with the three carriers you cite were available to\nthem for use in such a capacity in 1942?\n9. Since German military production increased 278 percent from 1942\nto 1944 while being bombed on a daily and nightly basis, while\nUS production increased only 206 percent over the same period,\nis it reasonable to assume that Japanese spot raids would have\nslowed US production or the war effort at all? If your answer is\nyes, please explain how and why.\n10. Did the risk of these potential spot raids alone justify\ninternment?\nPlease provide clear, specific and unevasive answers to these questions; you can offer qualifiers, explanations and assertions of whatever you like in a separate rebuttal.\nUninformedly yours,\nVox Day",
