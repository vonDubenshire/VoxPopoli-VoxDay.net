He was trying to trade Burleson for Stephen Jackson for the last two weeks, (he has Marshall Faulk), but I refused.  Burleson comes out of the game, Robinson goes in, Culpepper to Robinson for 3 yards and a TD.

What happened to the Ravens defense?  And is there anything more fun than shouting “I’m a soldier” every time anyone mentions Kellen Winslow?  The White Buffalo is already regretting drafting him.</p><p>9.  Carson Palmer can definitely play.  I no longer fear him ruining Chad Johnson’s numbers.</p><p>10. Happiness is trailing the defending league champion by one point, with your top draft pick still to play on Tuesday… oops, spoke too soon.  Four TDs from Daunte midway through the third quarter and the game is over.  1-0.  You can save the scores for next week, Mr. Green!<br/></p></div>",
