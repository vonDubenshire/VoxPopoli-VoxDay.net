Deion is a unique talent, but for all his theatrics, he’s always been a team player on the field, willing to subordinate his massive ego for the good of the team.  I think it’s interesting that despite how many people loathed from the start, I’ve never heard any of his teammates say a bad word about him.</p><p>Okay, perhaps Andre Rison, but then, when has Andre Rison had a good word to say about anyone?<br/></p></div>",
