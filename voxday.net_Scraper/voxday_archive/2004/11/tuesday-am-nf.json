I’m not sure that the problems in Miami are entirely Dave Wannstedt’s fault, but his resignation is probably the best thing at this point.

It was funny listening to Phil Simms commenting on the Patriots-Rams game and mention that Sean Landetta was punting for the Giants back when Simms was winning Super Bowls with them.  Running backs may get a lot more glory, but a career as an NFL punter is probably the better bet.  Not that most of us are likely to face a choice in the matter.<br> <br>8.  I have no clue what to do with regards to when picking a game featuring one of the following teams: Detroit, New York Giants, Kansas City.  Never bet on the NFL.  Any Given Sunday isn’t just an empty phrase.<br> <br>9.  Philadelphia, meet The Real Terrell.  Has Vegas laid odds on McNabb punching him in the face before the end of the season?  McNabb made all the right noises after the game, but this was just the first time Owens has lost it.
