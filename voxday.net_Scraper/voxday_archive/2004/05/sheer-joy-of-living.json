The boy doesn’t see his father very often, so I named him captain for the tournament and started him although he’s usually a substitute.  He really put on a show in return, scoring a lovely goal in the first game, crossing the ball for a headed goal in the semifinals, and getting the team out of trouble in front of our own goal with an incredible step-on-the-ball-and-spin move that somehow evaded two opposing players in the finals.
