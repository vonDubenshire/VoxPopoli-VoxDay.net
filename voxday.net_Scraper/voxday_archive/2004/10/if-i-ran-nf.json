Forbid the “star and storyline” approach to coverage of the games.  Tell the networks to hire real sportscasters who will talk to the fans, not to the half-interested folks who are never going to get sucked in to full fandom just by hearing Olympics-style blather about the players’ personal lives.  Unless you’re going to show fifty pictures of Jessica Simpson walking her dog and completely turn into US magazine, you’re not going to get their allegiance.<br> <br>15. Create a Dick Bavetta of the NFL, who would be in charge of refereeing all Vikings playoff games in order to make sure they get the breaks when needed.  The Lakers and Knicks have Bavetta, Manchester United has Mike Riley, doesn’t Minnesota deserve a referee to call its own?  (Totally kidding, I’m as desperate for a Vikings Super Bowl victory as any Boston fan was for a Red Sox championship was until this week, but I want a real one.  I want to beat the Giants and the Redskins in the playoffs, then stomp all over the Steelers for the ultimate victory.)<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></div>",
