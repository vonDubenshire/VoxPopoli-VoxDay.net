I offered a fistful of Kleenex to her but she patted my hand and told me she was fine.  I started to bring my hand back when suddenly this big hand reached over from across her and snatched the lot from me.

I love “Do You Hear the People Sing” as well as the confrontation between Javaer and Valjean that ends with that dual promise, but upon further reflection, I have to go with “Stars”.  The deep bass, the rectitude masking desperate self-loathing and the tragedy of a man being destroyed by that which has made him successful simply sets it apart from a set of songs that are lyrically excellent as well as amazingly well-crafted – though admittedly simplistic and emotionally manipulative – from a musical point of view.<br/></p></div>",
