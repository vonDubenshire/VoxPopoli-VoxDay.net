The Patriots should have sewn up the game much earlier, but for Weis’ usual habit of getting whacky at inopportune times.

I thought it was what TMQ calls a fraidy-cat move, telling your defense that you don’t trust them to get the ball back or at least hold New England to a field goal.  That decision may not have made any difference as they lost by more than two in the end, but it’s impossible to say for certain.  Unless you’re a total psycho who goes for two automatically, save it for when it’s necessary and then have a play ready.
