That being said, the clear-cut winner was about as artistically simple as a meme can be.

VFM, this one’s optional, but encouraged, particularly for those who are skilled in the dark arts of visual rhetoric.</p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-63871\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"481\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" src=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-51.png\" srcset=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-51.png 512w, https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-51-300x282.png 300w\" width=\"512\"/></noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-63871\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" data-src=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-51.png\" data-srcset=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-51.png 512w, https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-51-300x282.png 300w\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"481\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20512%20481%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"512\"/></figure></div><p><em><a href=\"https://social.infogalactic.com/micropost/477ac060-4f9b-459d-9f32-1b304e21a7fb\">DISCUSS ON SG</a></em></p></div>",
