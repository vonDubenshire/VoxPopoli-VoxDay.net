Mutation rate is like the frequency of new model launches, while fixation rate is like observing how quickly each new model becomes the dominant one used by the public. Selective events are like market conditions that favor the rapid adoption of certain models over others (e.g., a significant technological advancement).\nUnderstanding Fixation Rate with an Example\nThe fixation rate in a population genetics context refers to the frequency at which a particular mutation becomes present in every individual of a population, effectively replacing all other versions of that gene. Let’s break down the concept of fixation rate using a simplified example.\nExample: Introducing a Beneficial Mutation in a Small Population\nImagine a small population of 1000 butterflies. A mutation occurs in one butterfly that makes its wings brighter, potentially giving it a better chance of avoiding predators.\nStep 1: Mutation Occurs\nInitial mutation\n: One butterfly develops a mutation for brighter wings.\nPopulation size (N)\n: 1000 butterflies.\nNumber of mutants at the start (m)\n: 1.\nStep 2: Determine Fixation Probability\nFor a beneficial mutation, the fixation probability can be higher than that of a neutral mutation. If we assume this mutation offers a slight survival advantage, let’s denote the selection coefficient by 𝑠\ns\n, where 𝑠\ns\nis small, say 0.01 (1%).\nThe fixation probability (𝑃\nP\n) for beneficial mutations can be approximated using the formula:\n𝑃(𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛)≈2𝑠1−𝑒−4𝑁𝑠P(fixation)≈1−e−4Ns2s​\nPlugging in our numbers:\n𝑁=1000 (population size),\n𝑠=0.01 (selection advantage).\n𝑃(𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛)≈2×0.011−𝑒−4×1000×0.01P(fixation)≈1−e−4×1000×0.012×0.01​ 𝑃(𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛)≈0.021−𝑒−40P(fixation)≈1−e−400.02​\nSince 𝑒−40\ne\n−40 is a very small number close to zero, the formula simplifies to:\nStep 3: Calculate the Fixation Rate\nThe fixation rate involves how quickly this mutation spreads through the entire population until it becomes the only variant present. This rate not only depends on the fixation probability but also on factors like the generation time and population dynamics. If the mutation indeed confers a survival advantage, and given that the probability of fixation is about 2%, it implies that in favorable conditions, it might eventually spread to the entire population.\nStep 4: Observing the Outcome\nGenerational time\n: Assuming each butterfly generation spans one year.\nOver many generations, we observe whether the mutation spreads and reaches fixation (where all 1000 butterflies have the mutation) or is lost due to drift or other factors.\nKey Takeaways\nFixation Probability\n: Even with a beneficial mutation, the probability of fixation isn’t guaranteed but is significantly higher than for neutral mutations. In our example, there’s a 2% chance the beneficial mutation will fixate in the population.\nImpact of Population Size\n: Larger populations may see a slower spread of mutations due to their sheer size and genetic diversity.\nRole of Selection Coefficient\n: A higher 𝑠\ns\nvalue (greater advantage conferred by the mutation) increases the probability of fixation.\nDISCUSS ON SG",
