But I am not sure that the methods and limitations of Wellington’s system are fully appreciated. For it is not sufficient to lay down the general thesis that he found himself opposed by troops who invariably worked in columns, and that he beat those troops by the simple expedient of meeting them, front to front, with other troops who as invariably fought in the two-deep battle-line.

Troops who are armed with missile weapons, and who hope to prevail in combat by the rapidity and accuracy of their shooting, must necessarily array themselves in an order of battle which permits as many men as possible to use their arms freely. This was as clear to Edward III at Crecy, or to Henry V at Agincourt, as to Wellington at Bussaco and Salamanca. A shooting-line must be made as thin as is consistent with solidity, since every soldier who is placed so far to the rear that he cannot see the object at which he is aiming represents a lost weapon, whether he be armed with bow, or with musket, or with rifle. Unaimed fire was even more fruitless in the days of short ranges than it is in the XXth century. And the general principles which guided an English general who wished to win by his archery in the Hundred Years War were much the same as those which prevail today.</em></p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://castalialibrary.substack.com/p/studies-on-the-napoleonic-wars-030\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-62153\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"340\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" src=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-18.png\" srcset=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-18.png 512w, https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-18-300x199.png 300w\" width=\"512\"/></a></figure></div><p>The reason this topic is relevant today, more than 200 years later, is that rather like the period in the 17th century when the dispersed shooting line disappeared in favor of dense columns and the post-Civil War period when artillery and machine guns made it necessary to eliminate both line and column entirely, the battlefield is undergoing another period of tactical reconsideration, this time brought about by new <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2024/03/08/russian-fiber-optic-drone-can-beat-any-jammer/\">drone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-13172545/AI-drone-designed-hunt-kill-people.html\">facial recognition</a> technology.</p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-62155\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"302\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" src=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-20.png\" srcset=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-20.png 322w, https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-20-300x281.png 300w\" width=\"322\"/></noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-62155\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" data-src=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-20.png\" data-srcset=\"https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-20.png 322w, https://voxday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-20-300x281.png 300w\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"302\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20322%20302%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"322\"/></figure></div><p>These developments may, in fact, render the battlefield itself obsolete.
