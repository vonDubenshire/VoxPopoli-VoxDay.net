Dawkins’s central thesis was not only wrong, it was backward. Christianity and science are not only NOT at war, Christianity is a necessary condition for science, logically, historically, and observably.\nUPDATE:\nBruce Charleton notes that Richard Dawkins simply\nlacks the intellectual courage\nto question his godless convictions, or even to contemplate the relevant evidence.\nA few years ago I met Richard Dawkins at a small, relaxed party.\nI had a question I wanted to put to him.\nAt the time I was not a Christian, but I was interested in religions and was (for example) studying religiosity and atheism in relation to personality.\nI had discovered that over the same period of the twentieth century that the US had risen to scientific eminence it had undergone a significant Christian revival.\nThe point I put to Dawkins was that the USA was simultaneously by-far the most dominant scientific nation in the world (I knew this from various scientometic studies I was doing at the time) and by-far the most religious (Christian) nation in the world.\nHow, I asked, could this be – if Christianity was culturally inimical to science?\nDawkins simply shook off this point, with a literal shake of his head looking downwards, and the comment to the effect that the scientists and Christians were two entirely different groups of people.",
