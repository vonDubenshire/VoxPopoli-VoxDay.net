A California federal judge dismissed the complaint in March 2018 on the grounds that YouTube isn’t a public forum run by a state actor and can regulate videos uploaded to the site as it sees fit.\nOn Wednesday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision and rejected PragerU’s contention that the site has become a digital-era public forum and its power to moderate content is a threat to fair dissemination of conservative viewpoints on public issues.\n“Using private property as a forum for public discourse is nothing new,” writes Circuit Judge M.
