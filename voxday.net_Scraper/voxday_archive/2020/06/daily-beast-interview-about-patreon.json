Do you think that’s a fair account of what happened?\nNot at all. Patreon violated their rights just as it violated my       rights when it tortiously interfered with the separate legal       contract between me and them. They are exercising their right to       legal redress, which Patreon mandated be done through arbitration,       just as I am.
