One source says raided, 2 don’t know.” </i></p><p>None of the usual “libs” in the comments attacking Housley or minimizing his story. Nor are the reporters from ABC, NBC, and CNN tweeting back and forth with him like they did a few days ago to call him irresponsible for saying if there are allegations of fraud, they should be checked out. Like talking about surveillance, they were told to try and let this one just drift away into the fog quietly, not call attention to it, and hope nobody noticed. </p><p>Also note, Sidney Powell is literally a close associate of/lawyer for Michael Flynn, so she has a pipeline into the most secret areas of the intel community, so it is no surprise she was right. What this all means is <i>Trump is playing to win.</i> </p><p>From that, you can infer that one, he did not just start yesterday – all of this was planned, and two, they didn’t raid a super classified CIA server farm filled with NOCs and dedicated to election hacking across the globe off of somebody’s random guess. Three, if successful (and they would be, as they would not raid such a facility off of a guess), it means there is no doubt, Trump is taking office in January, and the salt will be <i>glorious </i>– of a level nobody may ever again see in anyone’s lifetimes. It also means they are going to blow the whole thing open, and it will be as shocking as Q promised. </p></blockquote><p>This whole election fraud situation is looking more and more like a massive sting. And it also explains why President Trump was campaigning like a madman right up until Election Day even though he knew he was going to win.
