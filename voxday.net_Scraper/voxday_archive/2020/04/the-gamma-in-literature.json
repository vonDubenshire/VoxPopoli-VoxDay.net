On his left foot he wore a shoe, and on his left hand a glove of smooth purple cloth.

He was now a most beautiful, if quite abnormal sight.</i><br><i><br/></i><i>“Pretty child,” said Chuz, to Dunizel’s daughter, Soveh, “I will conduct you from this uninteresting fane.”</i><br><i><br/></i><i>The child, Soveh, lowered her eyes, much in the manner of Chuz himself, though not for the same reason.</i><br><i><br/></i><i>“Should you not,” said Chuz, “wish to behold your inheritance? Do not be alarmed. I will shield you from the dregs of the sun, though it is almost out. I waited until sunset, from courtesy to you. I regret your mother and father have been called away on business. As your uncle, I propose to adopt you. In token of good faith, here is a gift.”</i><br><i><br/></i><i>The blue jewels came up again, and focused on an amethyst one. It was the die.</i><br><i><br/></i><i>Soveh did not take the die, but she regarded it, and as she did so, Chuz regarded her, and it might be noted that both his extraordinary optics were covered by sorcerous lenses of white jade, and black jet, and amber, that precisely mimicked a splendid pair of natural eyes. From a slight distance, one might be deceived entirely. Chuz had come out in his best, and no mistake, to woo the daughter of Azhrarn.</i><br><i><br/></i><i>But still she did not take his gift, though she glanced at him occasionally, without mistrust or trepidation, while the day’s last spangles perished on the threshold.</i><br><i><br/></i><i>“This is most hurtful,” lamented Chuz eventually. And, perhaps intending to provoke her, he turned his back to her. And found himself face to face with Azhrarn the Prince of Demons, who had that instant come up through the lake and the floor to stand seven paces away.</i><br><i><br/></i><i>Chuz did not seem abashed. He smiled delightfully, and the bronze mask smiled with him in complete coordination.</i><br><i><br/></i><i>“Well,” said Chuz, “I am not, it transpires, to play uncle after all. And I thought you had forgotten her, despite what it cost you to bring her about.”</i><br><i><br/></i><i>Azhrarn’s face was hard to be sure of. Cloud seemed to enfold him. But his eyes smote through the cloud. Few but Chuz would have been ready to meet them.</i><br><i><br/></i><i>“You and I,” said Azhrarn, “un-brother, un-cousin, are now also un-friends.”</i><br><i><br/></i><i>“Oh, is it so? You sadden me.”</i><br><i><br/></i><i>“Oh, it is so. And you shall be saddened, even if I must hunt you over the world’s edges to come at you.”</i><br><i><br/></i><i>“I see you condemn me out of hand.

Yet who permitted the whip to cut his palm and the three drops of his blood to fall and change to adamant?”</i><br><i><br/></i><i>“Chuz,” said Azhrarn so quietly he was barely to be heard, yet not a mote of dust that did not hear him, “find a deep cave and burrow into it, and there listen for the baying of hounds.”</i><br><i><br/></i><i>“Do you think I shake at you?” Chuz said idly. “I am only the world’s servant.
