It’s not fair, but then, what is?  Of course, once you recognize that unfairness is inherent to the system, you will realize that men also have an advantage, which is that women don’t have a reliable way of knowing who is rich and powerful, and who is not.

It’s almost absurd how a man who stops viewing women as beautiful pedestal-dwelling dispensers of love and social approval and instead looks at them as prey becomes almost instantly more attractive to them.  Single women are complicated and dynamic, which in male terms means that because what they want tends to change rapidly, there is no point in putting any stock in what they say at any given moment.  And once you figure out that women find your honesty unattractive… why are you still being honest with them?  Seriously, Asperger’s or not, is this difficult?  As I have had occasion to tell both men and women: “Sometimes people say things that aren’t true.”</p><p>When honesty is acceptable, women usually want you to tell them what you want; they don’t want you to always be asking them what they want.  They often want you to take responsibility for their decisions for them.  That’s why they have such common fantasies about being ravished and swept away and so forth.  So, to the extent that a man’s behavior is not in line with the way women’s desires orient – which is very often directly opposed to not only what they say they want, but what they think they want – a man’s behavior will usually be self-defeating.</p><p>For deeper insight into what makes women tick on a sexual level, I recommend reading Roissy or some of the Pick-Up Artist sites.  Like good predators, they study their prey incessantly and make a point of knowing them intimately.  I don’t recommend their attitude lifestyle because it is both immoral and ultimately unfulfilling, but it is at least an antidote to the misinformation under which so many men labor.  But there’s a very good reason why women are naturally drawn to men like me and Tucker Max; it’s BECAUSE we’re independent bastards, it’s not DESPITE that.</p><p>Now, that independence came naturally to me because Spacebunny was, and is, the only woman I’ve ever loved or even cared much about.  But we’re not talking about love, we’re talking about initial male-female interactions.  The key is that you can’t ACT independent, you have to BE independent.  For most men, it’s a process, but you can get there in time.  Never forget that there are plenty of girls on the girl tree.  If one happens to be out of reach, pluck another.  Remember, it’s not love you’re feeling, it’s just physical attraction and momentary infatuation.</p><p>So, I have no sympathy for the bitter nice guys.  They’re stupid, they’re stubborn, they’re reactive, and they’re naive.  It’s not hard to understand why no woman wants them to bend her over and take her hard.
