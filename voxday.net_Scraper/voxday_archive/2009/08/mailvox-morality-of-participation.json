So, in short, is it immoral for an individual to participate in a program like Cash for Clunkers?\nNo, I don’t think so.  Most people don’t have a sufficiently sophisticated understanding of economics to grasp the issues involved.  It is, however, very stupid to participate in it if you were not actively planning to buy a new car anyhow, though.\nSo then, are you saying that if a person does have sufficient understanding of the economics involved than it would be immoral?  It mostly became interesting to me because I don’t seem to have a problem being all self righteous and following through on the principle in the case of Cash for Clunkers because it’s just a car… but when I read your Dollars for Debt notion, I caught myself thinking… “Hmm… I might just be able to set the principle aside in this case.”\nI think in that case it would at least be possible to make the case for its immorality.
