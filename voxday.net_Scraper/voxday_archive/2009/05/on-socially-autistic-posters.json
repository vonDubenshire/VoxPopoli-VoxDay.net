Mr. Oliver is so hopelessly clueless that he doesn’t realize that the rules of this blog have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with what other people might happen to do elsewhere on the Internet.  I am not responsible for my readers, I have no idea who most of them are, and to be blunt, I don’t care how they may happen to behave in the publicity of other people’s blogs.  It’s how they behave here that matters, and Mr. Oliver has demonstrated that while he may have read the rules, he clearly doesn’t understand them.  A few points:</p><p>1.  None of this has anything to do with me, Vox Popoli or free speech.  There is no free speech here, there is only speech that I tolerate.  I do happen to tolerate a broader spectrum of speech than the vast majority of blogs, but I don’t permit strange and obsessed people to span the comments.  Knock it off.  The main reason I posted this was to point out the copious flaws in your reasoning.</p><p>2.  It seems to have escaped Mr. Oliver that WBC can’t possibly cause those two young girls anywhere nearly as much pain their supposedly “gentle father” did.  Since I grew up on the same street as a family where the older son committed suicide, I suspect their views of their father’s choice of when to die will run rather closer to WBC’s than yours.</p><p>3. WBC sounds a lot more like someone who knew the dead atheist and is angry at him for selfishly killing himself than a sadist who wishes to obliquely torment anyone, let alone the suicide’s family.</p><p>4.  Your conception of the dead man’s fate bears absolutely no resemblance to any actual theology.  How, one wonders, could an anonymous comment on a dead man’s web site possibly prove anything about who will, or who will not, enter into the kingdom of Heaven?  There are many gods, the Christian God among them, who make it very clear that they will not welcome one who has rejected them, and rejected the very gift of life itself, into their presence.</p><p>5.  If you’re an atheist and you kill yourself, you should probably expect people to conclude that your action is evidence that atheists are unhappy, angry, nihilistic individuals.  This is certainly not true of all atheists, given that most of them appear to be capable of living out their days without offing themselves, but the astute observer will probably notice that a statistical predilection for suicide tends to fly in the face of the Atheists are Happy! propaganda put out by American Atheists.  So, atheists, if you want to score a point against those stupid Christians, don’t kill yourself!</p><p>6.  If the auto-deceased was correct, he was merely a specific collection of atoms.  He arranged to disperse those atoms into different patterns.  Why should this dispersal be of any concern to WBC, the related atom collections or anyone else?  I, for one, can testify that it doesn’t trouble me in the slightest.</p><p>7.  Learn to HTML link.  And spell.</p><p>8.  This blog has no problem whatsoever with WBC.  Whoever he is.  It do<br> es have a problem with you at the moment.  Keep this discussion here on this thread and it won’t.</br></p><p>In summary, Mr. Oliver, you appear to be a rather stupid and socially autistic individual whose reading comprehension and logical capacities are as deficient as your theology.  I won’t pretend to be able to clock down slow enough to understand what your point in spamming the comments here was supposed to be, but on the slim chance that doing so might see some sense slapped into you by the regulars here, I have permitted you an unedited platform.  Any comments you might have on the matter belong here and nowhere else on this blog.</p></div>",
