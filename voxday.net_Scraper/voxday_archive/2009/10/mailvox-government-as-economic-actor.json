I guess the discussion should be more about the source of the Government funds. If the 700 billion is something that Government “saved” from the tax money, then it is “good money” that cannot devalue the currency and hence the stimulus is good.

First, government money doesn’t come from nowhere, it is either taken out of the private economy or printed.  Printing the money is bad because it directly reduces the value of money through inflation.  It would have to generate at least $700 billion in new economic activity just to break even; since the calculated multiple of World War II government spending was 0.8, this means that inflation-based government spending is always a net loser even when it is considered to have been successful.</p><p>If the spending is tax-based, then this requires that the $700 billion in government-dictated economic activity be more effective than the $700 billion in private economic activity it replaces.
