This includes all the books, all the media, all the journals, all the source code, and the complete database behind mises.org.</p><p>This is not a one time release – I have created a public repository so you can get the latest version of everything as soon it hits the site.</p></blockquote><p>Nice to see IP opponents continuing to put their material where their mouths are.  And what a fantastic resource!  I’d encourage everyone who subscribes to the Austrian school to consider hosting a prominently displayed book or two on their blog.  I plan to make a few downloads available here, starting with Thomas C. Taylors’s <i><a href=\"http://mises.org/books/introtoaustrian.pdf\">Introduction to Austrian Economics</a></i>, and, of course, Murray Rothbard’s <i><a href=\"http://mises.org/rothbard/agd.pdf\">America’s Great Depression</a></i>.</p></div>",
