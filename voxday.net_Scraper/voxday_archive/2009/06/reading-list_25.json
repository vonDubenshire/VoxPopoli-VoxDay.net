While I was impressed with Koo’s balance sheet recession theory and his accessible writing style, a few historical errors of fact were surprising and I don’t buy into his policy recommendations that ultimately amount to a circuitous entrance of neo-Keynesianism by the back door.  It’s great that he recognizes when monetary policy simply isn’t working, but the answer is not a perfectly timed injection of expansionary fiscal policy.  I don’t know how much Austrian theory Koo knows, but it strikes me that aspects of his theory are perfectly compatible with it.</p></div>",
