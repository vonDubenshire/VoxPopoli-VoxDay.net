It felt great and everything except the very last rep at 270 went up easily.  I suspect it will take a while for me to get back where I was, but I seem to have retained a bit more strength than I’d dared to hope.  I also have a workout partner 3x per week who is one of those fill-out-the-card types and his mania for always going to the gym at the same time has probably been a good thing too.  Partly due to the shoulder injury, which ironically only affected my chest workouts, I’ve been on a shoulder kick for a while now.
