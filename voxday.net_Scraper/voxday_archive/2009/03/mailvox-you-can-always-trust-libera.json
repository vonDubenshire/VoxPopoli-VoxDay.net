ALL UNDER GEORGE BUSH’S REIGN. HOW DO YOU FUCKING FORGET THAT SO EASILY? HOW? HOW? HOW? HOW? HOW?  Obama is a fall guy for  all of this and if you really look at what has happened there is nothing any one person can do. There is no right answer, we are outside the petrie dish now. why do conservatives always champion god and the right to life while killing people (mostly children and women in foreign lands?) and yet call yourself ‘right to life’ a real right to life conservative would do anything to stop the war, cause thats where all the killing takes place. and why do all you conservatives never balk at endless military spending but then get up in arms (no pun intended) when anyone tries to spend some of our own tax revenue not on the annihilation of other peoples but on helping our own peoples?</p></blockquote><p>George Bush deregulated nothing.  He didn’t have the ability to do so.  SM doesn’t know that Congress repealed Glass-Steagell in 1999, when Clinton was president; banking deregulation was supported by Democrats and Republicans alike.

He is responsible for his own actions, which have been incredibly stupid.  Since SM believes that George Bush’s DEBT AND SPEND approach was bad, why doesn’t he believe that Barack Obama’s decision to engage in an even bigger DEBT AND SPEND program is worse?  The stock market isn’t getting killed because of Bush’s actions any longer, it’s reacting to Obama’s embrace of a ruinous Keynesian approach that will extend and deepen the depression.</p><blockquote><p><i>‘the thought of four more years of the ongoing presidential debacle’</i> whoa hold on. presidential debacle? WTF????? who got us into this? i have been watching this whole country loose itself and ruin itself under Bush for the last 8 years, he is the ‘debacle’ if there ever was one. what was his approval 22%? c’mon bro put the blame where it belongs</p></blockquote><p>Bush was a disaster.  Obama is already a debacle; it’s interesting to note that at the same stage in his presidency, Bush had higher approval ratings than Obama does now despite the 2000 election controversy.
