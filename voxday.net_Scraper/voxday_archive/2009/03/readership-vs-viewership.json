Consider that the average reader reads 200 words per minute, which is 3.33 words per second.  Since the average visit length to Pharyngula is only 9 seconds, this means that the average read per visit is 30 words.  The post that the commenters were discussing is 920 words, which indicates that either 1) Pharyngulans needed to visit his blog more than 30 times on average in order to read the whole thing, 2) Pharyngulans are all extraordinary speed readers who read several times faster than a very fast speed reader’s rate of 16.67 words per second, or, rather more likely, 3) Pharyngula is far less popular than the Sitemeter statistic of average visits per day would indicate and the number of visits are, as the commenter surmised, being significantly inflated by recounting regulars who bang the refresh bar like trained monkeys in order to read new comments.*  This isn’t just a Pharyngula phenomenon either, as many of the supposedly more popular blogs show the same sign of visit-count inflation.</p><p>Compare, for example, Pharyngula with a blog that is theoretically the same “size”, but is noticeably more influential in the blogosphere and theoretically more widely read, Ace of Spades HQ.</p><p><b>PHARYNGULA</b><br>V/D: 72,120 <br>VL: 9 seconds<br>RPV: 30 words <br>RPD: 2,163,600 words</br></br></br></br></p><p><b>ACE OF SPADES HQ</b><br>V/D: 72,709 <br>VL: 16 seconds<br>RPV: 53 words <br>RPD: 3,873,936 words</br></br></br></br></p><p>It’s clear that although the number of visits per day are almost identical, people read nearly twice as much at Ace’s as they do at PZ’s.
