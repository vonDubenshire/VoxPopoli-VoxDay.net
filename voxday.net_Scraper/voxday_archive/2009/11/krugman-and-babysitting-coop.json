The physical limit is that a couple cannot possibly make use of  more than seven evenings-worth of coupons per week since that is the maximum number of evenings they can go out and leave the children home.  The practical limit is the financial resources the couple has to spend on going out, and the psychological limit is based on the amount of the couple’s desire to actually spend evenings with their children.  If, in a given time period, any of these three limits are exceeded by the amount of the coupons distributed or loaned out to the couple, the couple will not make use of them regardless of how many more coupons they are given.
