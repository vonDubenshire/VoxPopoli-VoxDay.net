The thought that I could be sitting here now as an adult knowing that thousands of photos of me as a child were all over the internet, along with thousands of blog posts about my behavioral problems, temper tantrums, and pooping habits, makes me feel sick to my stomach.

I think it is not only wrong, but reprehensible to shred the privacy of one’s own children this way; I don’t even like to see children’s pictures on Facebook which is at least somewhat limited.
