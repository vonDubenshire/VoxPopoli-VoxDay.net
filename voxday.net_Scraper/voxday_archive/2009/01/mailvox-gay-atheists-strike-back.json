If Christianity can be criticized for the failure of Christians to not wage the occasional war over the last 1,000 years, then surely atheism can be assessed and even criticized for the failure of open and avowed atheists – there’s no “allegedly” with regards to any of the individuals involved – to not slaughter tens of millions of defenseless people during the last century.

I write as a scientist by training and background, with a BS in Physics; and an MA and Ph.D in Astronomy from Harvard University.  The fact is that there is not a shred — not the tiniest shred — of valid, credible, persuasive evidence — actual EVIDENCE — for the existence of anything supernatural.  There is just no actual evidence for the existence of any kind of supernatural beings: Gods, devils, angels, demons; nor of supernatural events: miracles, resurrections, and the like; or of supernatural places such as heaven and hell.  And there is certainly no evidence for an afterlife: When you die you”re dead; it’s pemanently over for you.

For all that scientists sometimes whine about this, it is actually all to the good considering the fact that science is an inherently dynamic process and therefore a very poor foundation for what must be a generally static principle.  Dr. Kameny should be downright embarrassed to make this argument, as even Richard Dawkins has tacitly conceded the point.
