I’d intended to post on it prior to the spending/income equivalency discussion, but as it happens, the two are tangentially related so this will make for a nice step into the deeper examination of why Keynesians place such importance on what I assert to be a false simplicity that is the result of them practicing the Ricardian Vice:</p><blockquote><p>Broadly speaking, there are two ways you can get into severe deficits: fundamental irresponsibility, or temporary emergencies.

It’s normal and natural to respond to such an emergency by issuing a lot of debt, then gradually reducing that debt after the emergency is over. And the operative word is “gradually”: it would have been incredibly difficult for the United States to pay off its World War II debt in ten years, which Jim apparently thinks is the right way to view debts incurred more recently; but it was no big deal to stabilize the nominal debt, which is roughly what happened, and as a result gradually reduce debt as a percentage of GDP.</p><p>Consider, on the other hand, a government that is running big deficits even though there isn’t an emergency.

In such a situation, markets are much more likely to conclude that any given debt is so large that it creates a serious risk of default.</p><p>Now, back in 2003 I got very alarmed about the US deficit — wrongly, it turned out — not so much because of its size as because of its origin. We had an administration that was behaving in a deeply irresponsible way. Not only was it cutting taxes in the face of a war, which had never happened before, plus starting up a huge unfunded drug benefit, but it was also clearly following a starve-the-beast budget strategy: tax cuts to reduce the revenue base and force later spending cuts to be determined. In effect, it was a strategy designed to produce a fiscal crisis, so as to provide a reason to dismantle the welfare state. And so I thought the crisis would come.</p><p>In fact, it never did. Bond markets figured that America was still America, and that responsibility would eventually return; it’s still not clear whether they were right, but the housing boom also led to a revenue boom, whittling down those Bush deficits.</p><p>Compare and contrast the current situation.</p><p>Most though not all of our current budget deficit can be viewed as the result of a temporary emergency. Revenue has plunged in the face of the crisis, while there has been an increase in spending largely due to stimulus and bailouts.

The war has to pose a real threat to the nation’s survival, since losing the war renders future interest payments irrelevant.  There is no point in going into massive debt for war if you’re going to have to pay it off regardless of the outcome; losing the war has to represent a worse fate than going into debt.  Therefore, the equation varies depending upon whether you are being attacked by killer cannibals from Papua New Guinea or Victoria’s Secret Army.  The war has to be short-term, and it also has to favor the odds of not destroying your capital base.

This is, to put it bluntly, incorrect and arguably insane.  Numerous books, including RGD, have been written to explain how the present crisis is the direct and predictable result of irresponsible monetary and fiscal policies.  Moreover, since total credit market debt grew from $37.8 trillion in 2004 to $52.9 trillion in 2009, there is absolutely no reason to believe that the crisis is temporary either; it will likely take decades of debt-deleveraging and economic contraction to reduce debt/GDP from its present 3.7 to the sustainable long term level of 1.5.</p><p>Finally, the Bush tax cuts were not “a strategy designed to produce a fiscal crisis, so as to provide a reason to dismantle the welfare state”.
