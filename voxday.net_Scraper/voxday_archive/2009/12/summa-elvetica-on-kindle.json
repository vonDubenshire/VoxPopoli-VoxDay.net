Originally, I’d intended there to be two or three chapters set in the Elven High City which would be largely devoted to telling more about the elves and delving further into the intellectual issues.  So here’s the question: if I happen to write those chapters in the course of writing the new book, does it make any sense to add them to a revised edition of SE or not?  And if you already own a copy of SE, would this be something you would appreciate or simply find annoying?</p></div>",
