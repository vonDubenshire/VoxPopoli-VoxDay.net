  "content_text": "Paul Krugman has the solution to the economic crisis in his book published earlier this year.  You’ll never guess what it is!\nSpend Now, Pay Later\nThe basic situation of the U.S. economy remains now what it has been since 2008: the private sector isn’t willing to spend enough to make use of our full productive capacity and, therefore, to employ the millions of Americans who want to work but can’t find jobs. The most direct way to close that gap is for the government to spend where the private sector won’t.\nThere are three common objections to any such proposal:\n1.    Experience shows that fiscal stimulus doesn’t work.\n2.    Bigger deficits would undermine confidence.\n3.    There aren’t enough good projects to spend on.\nI’ve dealt with the first two objections earlier in this book; let me briefly summarize the arguments again, then turn to the third.\nAs I explained in chapter 7, the Obama stimulus didn’t fail; it simply fell short of what was required to offset the huge private-sector pullback that was already under way before the stimulus kicked in. Continuing high unemployment was not just predictable but predicted.\nThe real evidence we should be considering here is the rapidly growing body of economic research on the effects of changes in government spending on output and employment—a body of research that relies both on “natural experiments” such as wars and defense buildups and on careful study of the historical record to identify major changes in fiscal policy.
