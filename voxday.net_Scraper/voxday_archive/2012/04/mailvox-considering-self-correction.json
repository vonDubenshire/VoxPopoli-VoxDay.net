There is no substantial difference between one scientist re-running another scientist’s experiment and one accountant re-calculating another accountant’s books. In other words, science isn’t self-correcting in any meaningful sense even in its ideal form.”\nInteresting thought. Tilting a little in the direction of a “let’s have a definition war” argument, but an interesting thought. By that yardstick would you call the market, or engineering self-correcting?\nVery well, we can certainly do this the methodical way.  Rather than risk a definition war, I will first ask Azimus for his definition of “self-correcting” before I answer his question about the market or engineering being self-correcting.  I’m not avoiding his question, it’s only that as I’ve pointed out before, depending upon how one defines “self-correcting”, science is either NOT self-correcting or else it is TRIVIALLY self-correcting in the same manner that practically every human activity is.\nTo which Azimus responded:\nAs I read your post, it struck me that the definition of “self” is scaleable.

I see it as scaleable and will define the term thus:\nSelf correcting:\nan entity is self correcting if it contains a mechanism by which error is identifed and eliminated.\nVery good.
