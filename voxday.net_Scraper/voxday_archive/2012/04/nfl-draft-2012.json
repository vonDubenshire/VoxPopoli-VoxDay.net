It makes more sense for the Vikes and their running-heavy offense than for most teams that don’t even use FB much, but still, it seems hard to believe there weren’t any more pressing holes to fill.

His first-year performance was particularly impressive in light of how he spent good parts of it on the run.</p></div>",
