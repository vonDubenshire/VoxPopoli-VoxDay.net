Here are some of the things I found interesting:</p><p>1.  In the last five years, from 2007 through the end of 2011, 28.5 percent of ALL reported vaccine-related deaths for ALL AGES occurred between the ages of 2-4 months.  It is truly remarkable that a two-month period that represents one-fifth of one percent of a person’s expected lifespan should account for nearly a third of the reported vaccine-related deaths, especially because the death rate is much higher than in the two months that immediately follow childbirth.  That percentage is 13,500 percent higher than would be statistically indicated.  The pattern continues in 2012 as 55 percent of the 20 vaccine-related deaths reported so far this year took place in that same two-month window.</p><p>2.  I was too conservative in my estimates yesterday.  During that same five year period, 60 PERCENT of all reported vaccine-related deaths under the age of one occurred between 2-4 months.  The period from 2-3 months alone accounted for the previously estimated 40 percent.</p><p>3.
