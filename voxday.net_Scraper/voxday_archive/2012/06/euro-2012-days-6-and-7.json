I think he actually had too much time; that’s often a problem for otherwise efficient scorers.  I thought the Danes merited a draw, but a bit of untimely defensive carelessness combined with a powerful shot from Varela in the 87th minute cost them the point.  Contra my assumptions prior to the tournament, it looks as if Portugal will finish second in the group instead of Holland.\nGermany 2 Holland 1\nAside from Van Persie’s goal from outside the box after the game was largely sealed, the Dutch looked more like a second-tier team than a legitimate powerhouse.  Before his goal, Van Persie was dreadful for a second straight game, falling over his own legs, the defender’s legs, and even the ball.

Germany looked much better than they did against Portugal and at this point, it’s readily apparent that the two best teams are Germany and Spain, with Italy a distant third.\nItaly 1 Croatia 1\nA wasted game for the Azzurri.  It began on a bad note, with Balotelli up front despite his uselessness in the first game and that was the case again here, as Italy got its only goal from a very precise Pirlo free kick.  Italy dominated the game in the first half, but seemed content to sit back and defend in the second, which was a mistake because the defense was caught sitting very deep in the box and failed to jump on a cross to Mandzukic that he had time to trap and shoot from about five yards out.

Italy is in trouble with only two points to Croatia’s four, but should still qualify, as I can’t see them failing to take the three points against Ireland or Spain failing to beat Croatia.\nSpain 4 Ireland 0\nThis game was a classic example of the way that certain strikers are very dangerous against mediocre defenses while being ineffective against good ones.  Fernando Torres scored twice and looked like he was playing against boys as he powered through the Irish defense, while watching the Irish midfield try to deal with the Spanish midfield was like watching headless chickens try to solve a Rubik’s Cube.
