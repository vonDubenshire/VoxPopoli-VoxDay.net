Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?  What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare[e] the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?”</p><p>The LORD said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”</p><p>Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?”</p><p>“If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will not destroy it.”</p><p>Once again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?”</p><p>He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”</p><p>Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?”</p><p>He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”</p><p>Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?”</p><p>He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”</p><p>Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?”</p><p>He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”</p></blockquote><p>Questions:</p><p>1.  The Lord clearly states that He does not know if what Sodom and Gomorrah has done is as bad as the outcry that has reached Him.  Is He a) lying about His lack of knowledge, or b) telling the truth about it.</p><p>2.  Does “if not, I will know” indicate that He does not know at the time He is speaking?</p><p>3.  Do “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it” and “If I find forty-five there, I will not destroy it” mean exactly the same thing?</p><p>4.

Did God already know how many righteous men there were in Sodom when He said “if I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake”?</p><p>My expectation, of course, is that the Calvinists will resort to their usual intellectual contortions and deceitful word substitutions instead of accepting God’s Word at face value.
