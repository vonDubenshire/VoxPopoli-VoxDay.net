And it’s quite possible that if she does die, he will not be aware of it.

It is quite possible that my God knows less about your daughter than you do.

You should not tell a child that God has a specific plan made just for her, because not only is it possible that He does not know which husband she will choose in twenty years, He doesn’t necessarily know that she will be alive tomorrow. And it’s quite possible that if she does die, He will not be immediately aware of it. If, on the other hand, she lives through an accident in which the car is totaled, thanking God for protecting her may be giving Him credit for something He didn’t do or even intend.

To find out what is happening somewhere on Earth, God customarily investigates Himself or instructs others to find out about it and inform Him.
