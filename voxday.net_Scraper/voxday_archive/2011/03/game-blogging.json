Since I’m presently working on a Game-related project, I think the time has come to set up a separate blog devoted entirely to the subject.  My idea is to have seven bloggers, of which I will be one, each presenting the perspective of the one of the categories I have described in the socio-sexual hierarchy: Alpha, Sigma, Beta, Delta, Gamma, and Omega… plus one ♀.

I would prefer a mix of married and single, religious and irreligious, older and younger.  Note that I’m not interested in exercises in self-justification, such as explaining why you’re really a “stealth alpha” even though your last date was with a transsexual streetwalker in Las Vegas five years ago nor do I want Tucker Max fiction cribbed from old editions of Penthouse Forum.  Roissy already has the “I am Alpha, hear me roar” aspect of the subject well-covered, so what I’d like this new blog to bring to the table is both the painful stories of the past and the accounts of transformation, both successful and unsuccessful, from the present.</p><p>I’m still going to discuss the subject here as I have been doing, but I will also post there several times per week.  Please don’t volunteer unless you can reasonably commit to posting three times per week since a good blog should average around three posts per day.
