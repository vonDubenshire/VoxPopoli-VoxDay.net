But I very much agree with what he is saying here, which is that one act of omission, one moment of cowardice, one moral failing, is not definitive of any man.  And I also agree wholeheartedly that is shameful for people to pile on Paterno in an attempt to morally preen.  Posnanski isn’t saying that Paterno did the right thing or that he shouldn’t have lost his job.  Failure has consequences, after all.
