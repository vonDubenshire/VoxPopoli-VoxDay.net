Great athlete, but I doubt he’ll be able to read NFL defenses or have the patience to stay in the pocket and find receivers.  If he’s willing to work hard, his upside is Michael Vick.  Not awful, but you’re not likely to win a Super Bowl with him either.  Looks like Vince Young 2.0.</p><p>2) The Vikings need to draft Mallet or Dalton.  Yes, they’re not likely to be stars either and yes they’ll probably be overpaying, but they have more of a shot than Newton and more of a shot to be decent starters than Joe Webb.  The NFL is a quarterbacks league.  I would draft a QB first every single year until I had a keeper; there is no shortage of bad teams with great linebackers or wide receivers.</p></div>",
