(a) What is your attitude toward the theory of evolution? (b) Do you believe it should be taught in public schools?</i></p><p>Skeptical.  Of course it shouldn’t be taught in public schools.  Worry about teaching an minor aspect of biological science AFTER you are able to successfully teach reading, personal economics, and math, which is not presently the case.</p><p><i>9. Do you believe it is proper for teachers to lead students in prayer in public schools?</i></p><p>Of course.  A public school isn’t Congress and a prayer isn’t a law.

Is it fair to question presidential candidates about details of their faith?\nAbsolutely.\n2. Is it fair to question candidates about controversial remarks made by their pastors, mentors, close associates or thinkers whose books they recommend?\nIt’s fair, but don’t be surprised when the candidates don’t agree.

(a) Do you agree with those religious leaders who say that America is a “Christian nation” or “Judeo-Christian nation?” (b) What does that mean in  practice?\nOf course America is a Christian nation.
