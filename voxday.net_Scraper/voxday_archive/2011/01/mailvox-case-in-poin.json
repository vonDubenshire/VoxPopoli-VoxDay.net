If he asks for one, (and he almost surely will), just tell him that you’re serious about getting married and having a family while he has demonstrated that he is not.  Either he will propose within weeks or you’ll have saved several years of being strung along as well as your self-respect.  Just be sure not to fall for vague promises offered in order to keep you around in lieu of an actual proposal complete with date.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that plenty of men who would like to have wives and families don’t dare risk marriage in light of the heavily biased divorce laws.  However, if that’s the issue, expressing a ready willingness to either sign a pre-nup or make a covenant marriage in the states that offer them should go some way in allaying those perfectly reasonable fears.
