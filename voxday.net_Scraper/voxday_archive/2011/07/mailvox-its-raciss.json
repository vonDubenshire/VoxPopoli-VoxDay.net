But since he kept returning to the point, I will point out the errors of his statement.</p><p>Presumably due to his low IQ, Huey claimed that the Milwaukee crime rate had fallen from 2006.  But this is only true if one looks at 2006 and 2009; the crime rate actually rose from 2006 to an all-time high in 2007, then abruptly fell 20% in two years.  (Upon further research, 23% in three years.)  Moreover, there is no discernible trend; the crime rate fell 25% from 1999 to 2004, then rose 44% from 2004 to 2007, then fell 23% again.  Note, however, that while overall crime is generally down, assault – which is exactly the sort of crime involving “where a bunch of blacks jump some whites” – has risen 21% since 1999; it was up 67% as recently as 2007.</p><p>During that time, the African population has gone from 36.9% to 40% of the population.  The European population has gone from 45.4% to 37%.  And the Hispanic population has risen from 12% to 17%.  Huey’s second error is that he failed to notice that the demographic figures from the article are from the 2010 census and are therefore newer and more accurate than the pre-census statistics he cites from 2009.  In other words, he is wrong and whites are no longer the majority in Milwaukee.</p><p>However, it should be kept in mind that it is not necessarily pure demographics that matter with regards to crime, but also the demographics of the power structure.  For example, South Africa had a fairly similar population mix during the white-ruled Apartheid years that it does now, but its violent crime rate has risen dramatically since the end of Apartheid in 1994.</p><p>It is true that total crime in Milwaukee has continued to drop, at least according to the official statistics.  “Total violent crime was down 7.1 percent in 2010 from 2009, and decreased 23.1 percent since 2007.”  The problem is that, as was reported in the article I linked, it appears that this decline may be attributable to the police refusing to take statements or report crimes.  If a mass assault by dozens of African “youths” and multiple thefts show up in the headlines, but not in the police reports, then it is readily apparent that the crime rates not only have no discernible pattern related to racial demographics, but are entirely unreliable.  The incredible decline in assault in only two years tends to support the anecdotal evidence suggesting the apparent improvement in crime rates is primarily the result of intentional police under-reporting.</p><p>The fact is that it doesn’t matter if you want to describe a hypothesis as vibrant, Correct, or raciss, it will nevertheless be supported or falsified by subsequent events.  In this case, we can simply wait and see what happens as Milwaukee becomes increasingly vibrant.  If Huey is correct, it will not become less law-abiding and more violent.  If I am correct, it will, and Huey will forced to be concede that the “raciss” perspective is, in fact, the correct one.  I am not the least bit bothered by insinuations or even direct accusations of racism because I recognize that the objective facts are simply what they are.  My like or dislike for any individual, of any genetic type, does not determine Asian IQ ranges, African homicide rates or Arab predilections for rape.  They are what they observably are.</p><p>The tragedy of the multicultural debacle is that while it is incorrect to prejudge any individual by his genetic makeup, it is absolutely correct to make macrosocietal judgments about groups of people on that basis.  This is why one can empathize with the individual man who wishes to move to the suburbs to help his family escape the ghetto while simultaneously recognizing that the man’s rational action will likely bring about the eventual destruction of the very haven he seeks.</p><p>Sam Harris once told me that it is tribalism, not faith, that is the cause of conflict.  But our tribalism is bred into our very DNA, and cannot be eradicated through any amount of Correct thinking and reality denial.  There are only three possible solutions to the problem, each rife with its own terrible costs.  The problem is that most people incline towards one solution or another without any understanding of what those costs entail.</p><p>The Amalgamation solution, favored by Arthur C. Clarke and other SF fans, will necessarily involve the eventual subsumption and elimination of every historical nationality and tradition and reduce humanity to its lowest common denominator.  It is the world of Idiocracy.  It is, I would argue, the least likely outcome and the worst for humanity as a whole, as it is the only one that would appear to risk humanity’s survival as a species.
