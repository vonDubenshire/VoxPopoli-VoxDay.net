The situation is typical;  she has a “career,” divides everything equally, their marriage is 50/50, he brings her coffee in the morning and takes the kids to daycare, she is overwhelmed with her career, household tasks, children etc… oh, and she is on anti-anxiety medication and repeatedly denies sex with him due to her “not being in the mood.”</p><p>She told us about one night, while relaxing in the hot tub, he confessed to her, “I have never cheated on you.”   The response that followed is far from what he expected.  She became enraged….  The intimate and honest moment completely backfired on the guy.  She went on to explain to us that she is not impressed with his ability to remain faithful, after all, it is what is expected.  She piously expressed what is required to remain married to her.  The first of which is faithfulness.

He’s watched as other men, friends of his, have not done the same.  (Across the table he is nodding in agreement.) He has overcome demons and lustful thoughts and has kept his fidelity.  You should have told him how blessed you are to have a man of strength, but you don’t understand the nature of men.  You don’t understand just what he was telling you.</p><p>So in your overreacting, irrational nature, you verbally destroyed him.  His confession was met with disapproval and rejection.  Had you taken a moment to think rationally about the situation, you would have seen this as an intimate moment of truth and honesty.  You do not belong on a pedestal, you are just as fallible.  And with all of your glaring weaknesses, he is faithful to your marriage.”</p><p>My husband was able to discuss a bit about Game with him and will do so more when we see them again in a few weeks.

And while I don’t disagree with anything she has written, she does appear to have missed what most men will assume to be the logical explanation for the burst of inappropriate anger: the woman has already been unfaithful herself and his confession of faithfulness was heaping coals on her head.
