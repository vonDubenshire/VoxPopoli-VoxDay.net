  "content_text": "“It wasn’t until I had children of my own that I realized how utterly self centered and oblivious the boomer gen was.”\nThis is a very common GenX experience. And it’s all too typical that they call us “helicopter parents” because we don’t need the television to remind us that we have children at 10 PM every night.
