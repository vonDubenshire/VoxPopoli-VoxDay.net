I may regret Colston, but I’m confident that I don’t need Manning, who I suspect is more seriously injured than is commonly understood.  With a bad line, an aging Marvin Harrison and a departing Tony Dungy, I’m not confident that he’ll continue to be the superlative fantasy QB he’s been for the last three years, whereas I think Aaron Rodgers/Greg Jennings/Ryan Grant show real promise of becoming the Manning/Harrison/James of the future.</p><p>In the meantime, I’ll start Warner this week against a bad SF defense and either trade him before the deadline for a top WR to a team that’s interested or start him when I don’t like Rodger’s matchups.</p><p>UPDATE – Holy cats!  We didn’t have the Vikes-Packers this week, so I finally broke down and got the NFL Game Pass.  I went for the HD version, which is remarkably better than last year’s streamed video.
