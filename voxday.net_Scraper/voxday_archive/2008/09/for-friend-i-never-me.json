  "content_text": "Bane Walks On\nHe stalked into the shadowed vale\nHis six-gun at his side,\nA twelve-gauge strapped across his back\nAnd boots with knives inside.\nHe spared no glance for lives behind\nNor for the lurking dark\nThat shivered as he passed it by,\nEyes ever cold and stark.\nA shrouded wight stood in his way,\nIts bony hand did twitch\nWhite-knuckled on its wicked scythe.\n“Not you, son of a bitch!”\nThe tall man only grinned and told\nHis foe to go to Hell.\nThe Reaper bowed and stepped aside,\nA past lesson learned well.\nBeyond the darkness, blinding light\nCaused his hard eyes to narrow.\nAnd still the man stood tall and proud\nHis back straight as an arrow.\nThen thunder roared high overhead.\n“My child, you’re here at last!\nFear not, I have much work for you\nA labor long and vast.\n“I am the God of Grace and yet\nThere must be Justice too.\nI hear the cries of the despised\nThe wicked owe their due.\n“Some serve with harps and sing My praise,\nHosannas with each breath.\nBut you shall sing a different song,\nMy new Angel of Death.”\nThe tall man kneeled and bowed his head.\n“Lord, I shall do Your Will.”\nAnd then he smiled, baring his teeth,\n“Just tell me who to kill.”\nRequiescat in pace, Bane\n.",
