I truly appreciate both your personal support for me and your confidence in the book.  The surge was EXTREMELY successful, as our ambitious objective was to achieve a Top 100 rank overall and #2 in Atheism.  (We knew it would be nearly impossible to catch the newly released paperback version of <i>The God Delusion</i> with a hardcover… and yet we almost did!)</p><p>The final result?  #63 overall, #2 in Atheism, #4 in Religion, #28 in Hot New Releases and what was the biggest leap in 36 hours by any book sold by Amazon.  (It worked out to the third-biggest leap in the last 24 hours because of a few early orders.)  To put this in perspective, someone at the publisher was so pleased that she emailed me when the book reached #20,000 late last week.  The strong level of support that you have shown will give them a great deal of confidence in the ultimate success of the book… and the next one.</p><p>Since you bought out Amazon’s entire stock and then some, it will be a few days before many of you get your books.  I’m eager to learn what you think of it, and I hope everyone who reads it will consider reviewing it, either on their blog or on Amazon.  If you do write one, let me know where you’ve posted it and I’ll be delighted to provide a link to it.</p><p>So thanks again, and congratulations on a job well done.  It was a remarkable performance and I feel privileged to have been able to be a part of it.</p></div>",
