RE was behaving in a similar manner and making arguments very remniscent of those made by a previous troll who had been banned eight times and regularly makes use of different names  while hiding his IP address.  It’s hardly incomprehensible that “Recovering Evangelical” could be confused with “Cosmos” aka “Why Christians Are Wrong”, especially when similarly nonsensical accusations are being thrown.

I don’t bother wasting that kind of time and effort, though especially not when it’s someone who is so prone to slinging personal insults as you are.  And if RE is determined to behave in a manner as tiresome and repetitive as Cosmos, I won’t hesitate to add him to the list of 20 or so people who have been banned over the last five years.  His readiness to behave in an obnoxious manner doesn’t make me inclined to tolerate him for long.</p><blockquote><p>In response to my contention that “I see this as another one of VD’s misrepresentations,” you say “That’s because you’re stupid.” This is hypocrisy, because you ridiculed “BD” for doing the same thing to you.

This is a matter of public knowledge.  RE, on the other hand, has submitted a good deal of evidence demonstrating that he lacks the intellectual capacity to understand some fairly simple and straightforward concepts.  What applies to RE does not necessarily apply to me.</p><blockquote><p>So yes, you displayed cowardice when you deleted my initial comment, hypocrisy when you responded to it by claim that I was stupid, you lied when you painted me as another poster, and to claim that peer review isn’t science because some scientists display favoritism or other human faults, is “moronic.” Case made, charges stand.

I said it is: “little more than the scientific version of union thuggery.”  RE’s inability to comprehend what I wrote or understand why peer review is not science is why he can be reasonably be described as possessing sub-standard intelligence, which means that I am not a hypocrite.  While I was mistaken about his identity, he has not shown any evidence that I knew he was not Cosmos, (there had been some previous speculation by several regulars that he was), so he has no grounds for claiming that I lied.  My reposting of his argument and his nonsensical insults should suffice to belie the claim of cowardice.</p></div>",
