Just remember what ol’ Vox Day does when the Net quakes, the poison insults fall from the sky, and the pillars of atheism shake with fury.

As I wrote in TIA, the not-so-new atheists are afraid.  They’re afraid of religion, they’re afraid of what science hath wrought, they’re afraid of the future, they’re afraid that God just might exist, and most of all, they’re afraid to have their irrationality, ignorance and intellectual mediocrity exposed for all the world to see.  Whether the book ever receives a modicum of publicity or not is irrelevant; the truth it contains will eventually come out.</p><p>But Mr. Zara is partially correct.  Being a lifelong strategy gamer I have naturally worked out many convincing counter-attacks to all of the obvious atheist defenses, which is why none of the atheist icons are likely to ever dare confronting me in debate in any form.  (Heck, I’ve even named some of the inevitable atheist defenses, like the Fighting Withdrawal, Defiance on Hill 1917 and Zara’s own response, Silence That Gun.)  The Unholy Trinity would much rather take on the likes of Michael Jackson’s rabbi and other soft-spoken, decrepit old men, who wouldn’t humiliate them by taking them apart even if they could.  But this doesn’t mean that I believe I have an utterly air-tight case that is unrebuttable in even the smallest detail.  Despite being an Internet Superintelligence, I still make the occasional mistake and there’s bound to be a number of them in any book of 100k words.  That’s precisely why I maintain <a href=\"http://irrationalatheist.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6\">a public list of errata</a> over in the TIA forums.  (So far the dumbest error is when I dated the October Revolution to 1919, two years after it actually occurred.  I have no idea how that happened as I know perfectly well when it took place.)  But so far none have proven to be significant or even damaging to any of my arguments, and unlike the New Atheists, I recognize that the only way to continue to strengthen my case is to allow it to be tested by everyone, friend and foe.  That is why, unlike them, I neither fear nor ignore criticism, but welcome it instead.</p><p>So bring it, bitches.  Because if you don’t, you’re admitting to everyone of every creed or lack of creed that you’ve got nothing except complaints about my lack of etiquette.  Yeah, that’s deeply relevant coming from a group that actually uses the cretinous word “fucktard”….  And you can’t convincingly feign disinterest either, not after vandalizing Wikipedia, trying to substitute reviews of a four year-old editorial for a newly published book, posting one-star Amazon reviews of a book you admittedly haven’t read, and clucking like cowardly chickens from the safety of Richard Dawkins’s Internet embrace.</p><p>As for Diacanu, I can only say that <a href=\"http://richarddawkins.net/images/4h/part2_img.jpg\">a picture is worth a thousand words</a>.</p></div>",
