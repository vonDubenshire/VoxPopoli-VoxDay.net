If occasionally the stench of soul-rot is a bit strong hereabouts, well, it serves as a good reminder that no man is worthy of the faith and adoration of his fellows, no man but the one whose Way we attempt, each in our mean and stumbling way, to follow.</p><p>Let’s face it, propriety nearly always loses out to personal amusement when adjudicated in my civil court.  And in the interest of honesty, I have to point out that as much as I’d like to, I cannot take credit for coming up with the aforementioned appellation, although I am delighted to know that I played some small part in inspiring that flash of brilliant insight.  I am a King’s son, to be sure, but keep in mind that for every noble Black Prince there is an exasperating Prince Hal.</p><p>Anyhow, I’m glad JK enjoying the book thus far regardless.  I think I can assure him that there will be bits that he will like very much indeed, and other bits that will make him cringe.  The important thing is to understand that in this particular case, the one truly can’t exist without the other.</p></div>",
