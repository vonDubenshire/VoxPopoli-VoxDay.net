Second, VP is very clearly not the Republican haven that it is commonly supposed to be by liberals and unlike most blogs it is not read only by the echo chamber.  I was extremely surprised at how Republican-heavy Instapundit turned out to be.  And third, for all its radical libertarian extremism, VP is arguably more in tune with the mood of the general public than most political blogs, including Instapundit, as it’s quite possible that at least 52 percent of the American electorate will join the 534 readers here – and me – in refusing to vote for any of the declared candidates referenced in this poll.</p></div>",
