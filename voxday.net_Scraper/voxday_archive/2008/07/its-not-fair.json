Worrying about whether you will receive the blessings of Fame is the sort of thing that causes writers to seize up with writer’s block, which should more accurately described as literary constipation, or worse, to one day throw down your pen and declare, “Screw this!

I didn’t when life seemed to be outrageously unfair in my favor, and I didn’t when things appeared to be swinging the other way for a while.  I strongly suspect that God isn’t fair either; it’s not hard to understand why He might have chosen David over Saul, but why should He have favored David over Jonathan?  I’m sure He had his reasons, just as we have our own nonsensical reasons for preferring one individual to another.  Who am I to question Him?
