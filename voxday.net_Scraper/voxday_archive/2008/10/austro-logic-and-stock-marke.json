It is certainly true that the free market is the best provider of information related to the complex calculation of intersecting values, but the point that the Austrians who concocted this answer appear to have missed is that the stock markets no more represent free markets than NAFTA represents free trade.</p><p>The truly Austrian position would be to reject the concept of government-created artificial persons in favor of historical free partnerships which sell shares to anyone willing to buy them through any mechanism it cared to sell them.  Some form of recognizable bourse would surely evolve from these operations, but there would be no artificial limits on which organizations were permitted to sell shares through them, much less the bevy of government restrictions that currently exist.</p><p>The “socialist” answer, on the other hand, is demonstrably more correct.  Only the last sentence is incorrect, but it doesn’t have anything to do with the actual question of the stock market and its functions and so can be safely disregarded.  There’s nothing socialist about the rest of the answer except for the mention of “class”, which is not identified with any of the actual Marxian class divisions; the rest of the assertions made are undeniably true in the context of a government-regulated entity managing the trade in the ownership of other government-created entities.</p><p><i>The stock market represents the interests of an unproductive class in society. The investor class profits off of the labor of others, while roping the public into the system through investing schemes. Stock market speculation, insider trading, takeovers, and mergers, work to destabilize the economy. Financial acquisitions concentrate control of the means of production in the hands of a few.
