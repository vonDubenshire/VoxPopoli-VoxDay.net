Thus, Peterson isn’t just a bad guy or charlatan but an evil scientist or grand sorcerer of sci-fi or fantasy novels who must be utterly defeated. Vox Day’s war on Peterson isn’t merely over ideas or issues of character. Peterson obviously triggered Vox Day in a way that most people simply can’t fathom. Vox Day took it personally(even though the two men never met) because Vox Day has his own grand theory of the world.
