It’s almost like egalitarian nationalism, but it’s almost nationalism as egalitarianism.

And also, one thing we can learn from the ancient world, we can also learn from the modern world as well, there are hegemonic power blocs across the world. That is not going to go anywhere. We aren’t going to just simply devolve into little statelets, or city states, or neighborhoods, whatever they want. There’s going to be big kahunas out there, who have more power than others, and are going to form the geopolitical world order. That just is what it is.
