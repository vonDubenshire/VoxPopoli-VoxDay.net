so on and who are these  post-modern egalitarian neo-marxist and  where do you see any kind even of a  Marxism I see in it mostly and  important and utterly important  moralization well I mean organization  like jonathon Heights what’s it called  heterodox Academy and other  organizations like that have documented  an absolute dearth of conservative  voices in the social sciences and the  humanities and about 25{5fec4a8730436a0188ea9fdf5e7c2aa604b3dea71af4687f361fe67458d911a6} according to  the what I think are reliable surveys  approximately 25{5fec4a8730436a0188ea9fdf5e7c2aa604b3dea71af4687f361fe67458d911a6} of social scientists  in the u.s. identified themselves as  Marxists and so there’s that very solid  economic work David Harvey economic  analysis and so on and so on then there  is the old guy who is far from  simplification Frederick Jensen and so  on totally marginalized today it is  politically correct mainstream you know  I I don’t keep well yeah your question  seemed to me to focus more on the pair a  peculiar relationship that I’ve noticed  and that people have disputed between  post-modernism and and neo Marxism and I  see the connection between the  postmodernist types and the Marxists as  a sleight of hand that replaced the  notion of the oppression of the  proletariat by the bourgeoisie as the  oppression by one identity group by  another token okay so with that but so  now look precisely that’s it see I guess  that’s where we might have a dispute  because I think what happened especially  in France in the 1960s as the as the  radical marxist postmodern types like  Derrida and Foucault realized that they  were losing the moral battle especially  after the information came out of the  Soviet Union in the manner that it came  out  yeah that the whole blood is telling us  yeah the whole Stellan this catastrophe  along with the entire Maoist catastrophe  that they didn’t really have a leg to  stand on and instead of revising their  notion that human history and this is a  Marxist notion should be regarded as the  eternal class struggle between the  economically deprived and the oppressors  they just recast it and said well it’s  not based on economics it’s based on  identity but it’s still fundamentally  oppressor against oppressed and to me  that meant that they smuggled the the  the fundamental narrative of Marxism and  many of its schools back into the  argument without ever admitting that  they did so now I’ve been criticized you  know for this opposition because people  who are post modernists say look one of  the hallmarks of post-modernism is  skepticism of meta-narratives it’s like  I know that perfectly well and I also  know that Marxism is a meta-narrative  and so you shouldn’t be able to be a  post modernist and a Marxist but I still  see the union of those two things in the  insistence that the best the appropriate  way to look at the view world is to view  it as the battleground between groups  defined by a particular group identity  nin dividuals defined by a particular  group identity so that the group  identity becomes paramount and then the  proper reading is always oppressor  versus oppressed with the secondary  insistence that it’s very similar to  Marx’s insistence upon the moral  superiority of the proletariat that the  oppressors are by definition because  they’re oppressed morally superior and  and there’s the call for perhaps not  revolutionary change although that comes  up above but change in the structure so  that that oppression disappears so that  a certain form of equality comes about  now you argue that Marx wasn’t a  believer in equality of outcome and I’m  not so sure about that because his  notion of the eventual utopia that would  constitute genuine communism was a place  where all class divisions were  eradicated and so there’s a anesthesia  well well there’s at least an  implication like the most important of  the hierarchies had disappeared and so  maybe he had enough sophistication to  talk about other forms of hierarchies  but if if that’s the case then I can’t  imagine why he thought that the Utopia  that would emerge as a consequence of  the elimination of economic hierarchies  would be a utopia because if there are  other forms of hierarchies that still  existed people would be just as  contentious about them as they are now  like we have hierarchies of  attractiveness for example that have  nothing to do with economics are very  little to do with economics and there’s  no shortage of contention around that or  any other form of ability and so that’s  why I associate the social justice types  who are basically postmodernist with  Marx Postma their postmodernist with  Marxism it’s the insistence that you</p></div>",
