If you’re still not convinced the man is a complete intellectual fraud, just watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqJZeS1wDFc\">his speech at the Trilateral Commission</a> on the prospects for the survival of democracy:</p><blockquote><p>What can we do in order for democracy to  survive? So I would like that to be the  main theme for our conversation and I  can simply leave it with an advance, and  ask you, so what does it take, and, and  what can you do?</p><p>Well, I should tell you  first what I’ve been talking to people  about. So my wife and I have been on a  hundred-city tour since January, and I’ve  spoken to about 250,000 people over the  course of that in Australia, New Zealand,  and throughout the U.S. and Canada. Some  in Europe, mostly in the UK, in the  Scandinavian countries, I’m coming back  here in March, then to go through the  South in them and the East. When I speak  to audiences I always watched people one  by one because I never speak to the  crowd and always listened to the entire  audience, because what I’m trying to  manage when I’m speaking is to put  everybody in the same place so that  there’s dead silence. Because if there’s  dead silence, that means that everybody’s  concentrating on the same thing and that  everybody has come to a collective  agreement that that thing is up  substantive importance, and the most  reliable means of silencing an audience  of 2,500 people, regardless of where that  is around the world, is to make a strong  case for the relationship between  suffering, meaning, and responsibility.</p><p>And  the, the case for suffering, I think, is  quite obvious, because one of the things  that I point out to my listeners is that  life has a tragic element and we all  are perfectly aware of that, and then  we’re subject to that as fragile and  finite creatures, and that, that tragic  element is amplified by the human  proclivity for malevolence, psychological  level and at a social level and that’s  the reality that we find ourselves  confronted with, eternally in some sense, and that the proper antidote to that is  not the pursuit of happiness, and it’s  not even the existence of the individual  rights that are part of the substructure  of democratic society, but the  willingness to accept voluntary  responsibility for those preconditions  and then working to rectify them. And the corollary of that is that it’s  almost inevitably the case that people  find the meaning that sustains  themselves through suffering, and that  enables them to be motivated  sufficiently to constrain their own  malevolence is to be found in the  adoption of responsibility, and it’s  surprising that a message that has that  much weight, let’s say, and that little  frivolity, because there’s no frivolity,  let’s say, in that silence, is people, can  democracy survive?</p><p>Well, first of all, if  you ask the typical person in the  democratic society whether they would  like it to survive you’re going, the  resounding answer to that, it’s going to  be yes. The people who are working to  undermine it are a tiny radical fringe  on both ends of the political  distribution, let’s say, with a  disproportionate amount  exposure and power, and the people in the  middle are lost in some sense without a  uniting narrative. And a huge part of the  narrative that is united democratic  countries, since their foundation isn’t  the doctrine of rights, and it’s not the  doctrine of individual happiness,  it’s the doctrine that the individual is  the sovereign foundation of the, of the  polity, and maybe of the cosmos itself, which is something that I happen to  believe given the important rule that  consciousness plays in existence itself,  and that it’s useful and necessary to  call to people to remind them of their  responsibility as sovereign individuals.</p><p>And so I’m encouraging people to adopt,  to develop a vision for their life, to  adopt full responsibility for themselves, in a manner, and not in a manner that’s  that pertains specifically to their  narrow self-interest or happiness, but to  something that’s much broader in scope, to think that each person should take on  the voluntary requirement to take care  of themselves, but also their future self, because each of us is a collective that  stretches across time. And whatever you  do impulsively in the present merely  means that you sacrifice yourself in the  future, and that’s not a sustainable or  intelligent solution, and you want to  take on a responsibility for yourself  and your future selves in a way that’s  of maximal benefit to your family, if you  can manage that, and then, perhaps, if  there’s something left over in terms of  your capability, then you can do both of  those things in a way that maximally  supports and serves the community. And  for many young people that’s  something they’ve never heard is that  we’d be in a very bad case too, we’ve  made a very bad case, all of us, I would say.</p><p>I would  say that each of these people, each  person  has that sovereign responsibility, and  that if they adopt it, that actually  constitutes something of singular  importance, and that’s an old religious  idea, in some sense, that each person has a soul, let’s say, that is somehow a  center of reality itself, and that that  needs to be manifested in life itself,  and that if it isn’t manifested, then  something of tremendous value is not  brought forward. And worse, and this is  the end of the case, let’s say, and worse, to the degree that that’s not brought  forward then something hellish moves in  to take its place And people understand  this sort of thing a lot more clearly  than you might think, if you explain it  to them as if they might understand, and  then it gives them a seriousness of purposeness that straightens out their life. And so  my sense is the way that you revivify democracy is by remembering its  fundamental insistence that the  individual is at the cornerstone of the  state, and then everything you can  possibly do to fortify the individual, simultaneously, the individual is the eyes  of the state, the living individual is the eyes of the  dead state, and the living individual  revivifies the state.</p><p>And to the  degree that we forget our concentration  on the sovereignty of the individual, right, the divine sovereignty of the  individual, for that matter, then we  undermine the foundation on which  democracy is based and then people look  for alternatives. They search for meaning  elsewhere, extremist movements of one  form or another, or they collapse into a  kind of nihilism that’s completely  counterproductive. And so, well, so that’s  been my experience.</p></blockquote><p>This is the nonsense for which tens of thousands of marks pay hundreds of dollars to subject themselves. Notice despite all that useless, bafflegarbling word salad, he never even answered the questions he said he was going to address. And notice too the way in which he never stops selling his con.</p><p>How on Earth is the individual taking the sovereign responsibility for himself going to affect, in any way, the problem of foreign elites corrupting the political process to serve their own ends rather than the national interest? How is the mass acceptance of the voluntary requirement to take care of your future self going to hold dishonest representatives accountable for running on one set of policies and then governing on a wildly different one? How is what Peterson said even remotely relevant to the eminently justified widescale loss of faith in a political system that manifestly fails to deliver on its claims to represent the collective will of the nation?</p></div>",
