Free accounts have 140-character posts and 1MB storage, which is just enough for an avatar and a header.

Log in and log out to make sure that you’re running the latest version, which includes:</p><p>1)  Badges for member levels<br>2)  Character limits based on member levels<br>3)  Mobile improvements<br>4)  Moderator controls<br>5)  Notifications counters<br>6)  Position of post you are relying to in modal.<br>7)  X closes DM modal.<br>8)  Bio in dark mode<br>9)  Post counters on home page.<br>10)  Online user counter on home page.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p><p>Please keep in mind that SocialGalactic is NOT a free speech zone. Don’t be vulgar, don’t post nudes or obscene material, and behave in a civil manner. If you want spicy memes and bantz, you’ve already got Gab. Don’t bother asking for more image storage for free accounts, as we’ve identified that as a primary attack vector by trolls and monkey-wrenchers and we’re more likely to reduce the image storage than increase it.</p></div>",
