They think of the 18th century mercantilists that were supposedly routed by Adam Smith and David Ricardo. They think of the UAW opposing cheap Japanese cars in the 1970s. And they think of Pat Buchanan and his pitchfork populism in the 1988 presidential campaign. How are the arguments you put forward in <i>Free Trade Doesn’t Work</i> distinguished from those three things? </b></p><p>You’ve got to remember that those three examples you gave all consist of people who are, for one reason or another, disreputable in some way and in some currents of opinion but they are also people who did have a point. Mercantilism for example is not just something from the 18th century. It goes back to the very dawn of modern capitalism and the renaissance.</p><p>You have to remember that global trade is not something that was invented in 1990. It can go back hundreds of years back to the era when it was conducted with sailing ships. And very shortly after international capitalism began to take shape, various nations and their governments began to learn there were enormous advantages to be derived gaming the system. And surprise, surprise this is still going on it’s what China is doing today it’s what Japan has done for decades.</p><p>To some extent, it’s what the United States itself used to do for most of its history.  For most of its history the United States was very exclusively a tariff protected economy. The Founding Fathers were protectionists. The economist among the Founding Fathers is Alexander Hamilton, the guy on the ten dollar bill. And he wrote a report entitled “The report on manufacturers” which he submitted to congress in 1791, in which he layed out a rationale for protectionism that still holds good today. Hamilton was a very smart guy. Among other things you might be surprised to learn that he is the inventor of the R&amp;D tax credit, which he proposed in 1791.<br> <b><br/></b><br> <b>I had no idea. I knew he was big on central banks. I didn’t realize he was up on tax credits as well.</b></br></br></p><p>Yeah. The point is that mercantilism is not something that was brought out of the water by Adam Smith who was in many ways, although he was  brilliant guy, he was also the servant of various economic interests in his own time, particularly the economic interests of the Scots who had their own quarrels with the English.  Adam Smith is not a fully reliable guide in the sense that everything he said was true.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Free-Trade-Doesnt-Work-Replace-ebook/dp/B004UI6XL8/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1486056417&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=voxpop06-20&amp;linkId=c592485d1d110430ba14805a85b5acaa\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\" target=\"_blank\"><noscript><img border=\"0\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B004UI6XL8&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=voxpop06-20\"/></noscript><img border=\"0\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B004UI6XL8&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=voxpop06-20\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/></a>And you mentioned David Ricardo.
