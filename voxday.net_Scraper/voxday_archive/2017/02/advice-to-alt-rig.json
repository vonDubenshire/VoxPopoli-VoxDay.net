What you can do is build your own media platforms by relentlessly supporting the new ones coming on-line now…. Supporting the media that supports you means looking for a friendly source before going to the mainstream source. It also means the leaders and big shots of the movement need to stay the hell off the mainstream platforms. Milo doing Maher did everything for Maher and nothing for Milo.
