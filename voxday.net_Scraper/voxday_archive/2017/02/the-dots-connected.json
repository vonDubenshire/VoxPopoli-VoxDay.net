And whether you realized it or not, the various <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/01/30/five-arrested-in-pennsylvania-fetish-themed-child-predator-sex-ring/\">low-level arrests</a> of <a href=\"http://www.neonnettle.com/news/1871-hundreds-arrested-across-los-angeles-in-massive-pedophile-ring-bust\">pedophilia and sex-trafficking rings</a> that have been reported everywhere from Norway to Los Angeles <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-17/dhs-insider-warns-its-spy-versus-spy\">are a probable harbinger of things to come</a>:</p><blockquote><p> Q. So, in the Intelligence community, how chaotic is the atmosphere now?</p><p>A. In my 34 years of Governmental service, I have never seen anything like it.  It’s the bifurcation of the entire intelligence apparatus.</p><p>Q. It seems the intel community has it in for Trump – is this your feeling?</p><p>A. There are many Trump supporters within the FBI.  The CIA, however,  is against Trump because Trump threatens to ruin their game in the middle east.</p><p>Q. Can you elaborate?</p><p>A. CIA and Mossad work in tandem with British intel.  The goal for the CIA was to replace Assad with a puppet and to topple Iran so we could access their oil.  Israel works closely with it’s “sister”, Saudi Arabia, to help this dark cause.</p><p>Q.  So it seems like the intel community has it in for Trump. How can he protect himself?</p><p>A. Trump has a tremendous opportunity here, but needs to circle wagons. The travel ban included 7 countries chosen by both Jared Kushner and Rudy. Why did it not include Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan, or Turkey or other countries that hate us? The seven nations mentioned were chosen by Israel, that’s why. And the unspoken alliance of Israel and Saudi Arabia should be exposed. They are brother and sister. Jared Kushner needs to be careful with what he says and to whom. But, the biggest thing Trump can do is expose PedoGate via Sessions. Big names will go down hard, and it gets the blood suckers drained from the swamp. There are as many pedophiles on the Republican side as there is with democrats, but Trump is in a unique position to truly “clean up Dodge”, so to speak. I can tell you that what is in Anthony Weiner’s hard drive, and what videos exist via Jeffery Epstein, WILL BRING massive arrests – in time. Trump’s legacy could be truly great if he was to purge the CIA, stop the extortion, prosecute the pedophiles and reinstate the death penalty for pedo’s convicted a second time.  Pedogate is his path to greatness.</p><p>Q. How does Russia fit into all this?</p><p>A.  The CIA and Israel are responsible for the creation of Isis. Isis was created specifically to weaken Iran and destabilize Syria. It worked for a while until Putin shored up Assad and bolstered Iranian Qud forces. The real reason you see such anti-Russian fever from both Schumer and McCain, Graham and Feinstein, is because the operation has blown up in our faces.</p><p>Q. Is Israel behind the anti Russian sentiment?</p><p>A. Yes. Israeli intelligence is furious with Trump, and will do anything to keep Trump from working with Putin.  Understand that if Trump and Putin work together to defeat Isis, they are actually defeating a CIA/Mossad creation, and furthermore, Syria and Iran grow stronger, which the Saudis and the Israeli’s fear. Their goal was to divide Syria and ultimately destroy Iran’s regime. It is not just an oil grab, but a much bigger attempt at moving the chess pieces to allow Israel and Saudi Arabia to dominate the entire Middle East.</p><p>Q. So they demonize Putin and try to tarnish the Trump administration?</p><p>A. The Deep State is at war with both Trump and Putin. Understand that when Israeli intelligence hears “America first” from Trump, they go apeshit. Israel has bribed, extorted and intimidated our politicians for decades and suddenly this upstart billionaire threatens to ruin everything.</p><p>Q. You mention the word extort. Does that relate to Pizzagate?</p><p>A. PedoGate is only a modern term associated with a long history of Pedo-blackmail connected to both Israel and the Intel community. There is a full court press to stop PedoGate from being looked at because if people knew the true motives behind the pedophilia epidemic, they would do more than march on Washington. They could actually seed a revolution, with the spark coming from decent American parents who want to protect their kids. Our politicians are compromised. The senior analyst nicknamed “FBI Anon” alluded to this in his exchange with folks on 4chan and with you.</p><p>Q. What do you mean compromised?</p><p>A. Do you notice 2 central themes running through the MSM lately?  Those themes are “Fear the Russians” and “#PizzaGate is fake news“.  Both tropes come from the same place.</p><p>Q. Can you explain?</p><p>A. How do we exert power?  Via fear. Do you ever wonder why both Democrats and Republicans fall all over themselves to kiss up to Israel? Odd, since Israel is the size of Rhode Island… The fact is, many of our politicians – on both sides – have been compromised by CIA and Mossad for years. It’s actually not admiration they are expressing for Israel, but fear. Notice Lindsay Graham and Chuck Schumer repeating the same salute when it comes to Israel. How does that even happen? The American people are finally seeing that there is no two-party system, but one big shadow Government pretending we have political dichotomy.</p><p>Q.  So PedoGate is real and “they” have to get Americans to disbelieve it?</p><p>A. Let me explain how threatening PedoGate is… Who wins? Trump. Putin. Americans. Russians. The world…. Who loses? Israel, since they no longer can blackmail our politicians, the same goes for the CIA. The Shadow Government loses. But, the people win.</p><p>Q. Can you give me specific instances of politicians being compromised by Israel?</p><p>A. Sure. Lolita Island. Jeffery Epstein, a billionaire convicted of pedophilia received a soft sentence. His island was rigged with video recorders. Many politicians have been compromised. It was a Mossad/CIA operation. Contact ex-senior CIA CCS, Robert David Steele. Bob knows and has even spoken about this with numerous reporters.</p><p>Q. So an ex-CIA senior agent named Robert Steele is on record saying Epstein’s island was a honey trap to lure our most powerful politicians into a extortion scheme?</p><p>A. Yes. There are videos of some of the most powerful players in the most humiliating positions. If this gets out, not only are the politicians ruined, but the extortion game is over and suddenly, the influence CIA and Mossad wield over Washington, is gone.</p></blockquote><p>If I were advising Netanyahu, I would tell him to come clean and help the God-Emperor drain the swamp rather than try to keep the American people in the dark. Because the swamp is going to be drained. Now, I have no idea of whether any of this is true or not, but it certainly explains a lot of the panic in the media as well as the bizarre, seemingly unconnected connections between diverse aspects of the foreign policy drama, since the insider claims that one in three Washington politicians is compromised.</p><p>This bit was particularly interesting: <i>“Notice how blatantly hostile McCain, Schumer, Graham, and others are? It was what we call a “targeted trigger“. It worked. By long-kniving Flynn, they exposed their hand.”</i></p><p>I can’t help but notice Gen. Flynn’s position has not been filled…. Anyhow, those who complain that Pizzagate has led to nothing concrete simply haven’t been paying attention. Over one thousand pedophiles have been arrested around the world since November, and you can be certain that most of them are singing like canaries. We’ll know the next stage has begun when the media begins reporting a sudden epidemic of suicides among Congressional staffers.</p></div>",
