It’s the flavor that J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard have in common, once you remove what’s different. Tolkien and Howard are usually considered opposites – high fantasy versus swords &amp; sorcery, British versus American, literary versus pulp, and so on. But if they are opposites, they are opposite faces of the same coin, and that coin is heroic fantasy. Their worlds have more in common with each other, and with those of luminaries such as E.R. Burroughs, Clark Ashton Smith, H.P. Lovecraft, and Michael Moorcock, than with any of their contemporary epigones. Heroic fantasy is set in a world like our own world, one that might even be our world, in its distant past or far future. Its heroes, though men and women of extraordinary talent and drive, have none of the “super-powers” now common in contemporary fantasy (especially games). They do not typically teleport, fly, shoot fire, or raise the dead. Magic in heroic fantasy is more subtle and nuanced than in contemporary fantasy. It works with what is, rather than creating what is not. A magician cannot teleport straight to his friend’s distant castle, though his whispered dreams might reach his friend across the black gulfs of space. A magician will not fling magic missiles, but he might call down lightning from a storm, or capsize a boat with a wave. Working magic might require lengthy ceremonies, terrible sacrifices, or the power of primeval places. And those who use magic risk corruption. Even the wisest can lose their mind, body, and soul if they tamper with dark magic. That’s heroic fantasy.</p><p><a href=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/894/869/953c235f2566505d02c7e2c3588e4ea1_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1489702166&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=8c64e2a7b4e860e90be164ae42ec7cc4\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><noscript><img border=\"0\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/894/869/953c235f2566505d02c7e2c3588e4ea1_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1489702166&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=8c64e2a7b4e860e90be164ae42ec7cc4\" width=\"226\"/></noscript><img border=\"0\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/894/869/953c235f2566505d02c7e2c3588e4ea1_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1489702166&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=8c64e2a7b4e860e90be164ae42ec7cc4\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"320\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20226%20320%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"226\"/></a>Cleaving away decades worth of detritus of assumptions and expectations about how characters heal, fight, and adventure – how magic works – what spells do – and more, the Heroic Fantasy Handbook offers a fresh way to play with familiar D20 fantasy mechanics.
