While most of the attention has been focused on Alt★Hero the last few days, you can rest assured that neither the producer nor I have forgotten about the project.

I will send out the rest of the SJWAL copies as well as the promised Collected Columns after talking to Freestartr today, assuming I’m able to get access to the 105 missing emails.</p><p>Second, the initial microphone test has proved successful and I will test it in proper recording mode tonight. I have the necessary light, now I am waiting on the light stand to begin filming. I have already begun work on the first lecture, IMMIGRATION AND WAR, and we expect to release the first video before the end of the month.
