They must have seen them coming.”</img></i></p><p><i>He shook his head, trying to clear the cobwebs from his brain as he sat up. “Thanks.”</i></p><p><i>They splashed water on their faces, then made sure the spare horses were still securely picketed. When Lewis and Sandy arrived, they formed a line inside the trees on the west side of the creek, their guns ready in their hands. Walt favored his Winchester rifle and Isom his shotgun, while the other two relied on revolvers.</i></p><p><i>“What did you see?” Walt asked.</i></p><p><i>Lewis handed him his spyglass. “Thanks for lettin’ us use that, boss. There’s four of them, drivin’ our seven hosses an’ a pack horse.”</i></p><p><i>“Four? Not five?”</i></p><p><i>“We only saw four, boss.”</i></p><p><i>“I hope the other one hasn’t turned off somewhere. You sure those horses are ours?”</i></p><p><i>“No doubt about it. I recognized at least four of ’em through that spyglass. I’ve ridden most of ’em before. Will’s hoss is still carryin’ his saddle.”</i></p><p><i>“That’s good enough for me.”</i></p><p><i>They tensed as the riders and horses appeared at the top of the gentle rise, heading down to the ford. Walt said softly, “Wait until they’re all in the water. Lewis, you and I will be on this side of the road. Isom, you and Sandy cross to the other side and cover them from there. Let me do the talking. If any of them show fight or try to run, shoot them down. Remember, they killed Will, so they don’t deserve any mercy.”</i></p><p><i>“Got it.” “Sure, boss.” “Yes, suh.” The replies came in ragged unison.</i></p><p><i>“All right. Let me make the first move.”</i></p><p><i>They waited, the tension ratcheting higher as the group drew nearer. Walt patted the shoulder of his horse as it moved restlessly under him. It wasn’t scout-trained, and he didn’t want it neighing or making any other noise that might warn the men.</i></p><p><i>He watched as the four riders drove the eight horses into the water, one of them on either side of the small herd and the other two behind it. He waited until they were in the middle of the stream, their mounts splashing and stumbling over the rocky bottom, all their riders’ attention fixed on controlling them and the horses they were driving, then said sharply, “Now!”</i></p><p><i>The four thieves jerked upright in alarm as they burst out of the trees, weapons leveled. “Nobody move!” Walt barked. “If you try anything, we’ll kill you. Get your hands up! Higher, damn you!”</i></p><p><i>“What the hell is this?” growled one of the strangers as he slowly, sullenly complied.</i></p><p><i>“You know darn well what this is. You stole those horses last night.”</i></p><p><i>“Huh?” The man strove to sound convincingly nonplussed. “We didn’t steal them—we bought ’em from a freight outfit outside Colorado City.”</i></p><p><i>“Suuuure you did. I daresay you’ve got a bill of sale for them, all nice an’ legal?”</i></p><p><i>“Well… not with me, I ain’t, but I got one back in Colorado City.”</i></p><p><i>“Like hell you have! That freight outfit is mine, and you stole those horses. You killed one of my men when you took ’em, too. Sandy, Lewis, fetch our horses out of the river, then, Lewis, you hold them clear of the ford. They’re leg-weary, so I doubt they’ll run off. Sandy, soon as they’re out of the way, get back here. Isom and I will cover these bastards.”</i></p><p><i>“Yo!” “Yes, sir!”</i></p><p><i>The two teamsters led the horses away from the ford, then Sandy hurried back. “What now, boss?”</i></p><p><i>“Cover them.” Walt raised his voice. “You four, ride slowly—real slowly—out of the water and line up here in front of me. Remember, you’re under our guns, and at this distance we can’t miss. Any tricks, and you’re gonna die real fast.”</i></p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Brings-Lightning-Ames-Archives-Book/dp/B01M0BINU7/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B01M0BINU7&amp;pd_rd_r=CSBTXZF6A6W0V47XQ9K2&amp;pd_rd_w=zEtZP&amp;pd_rd_wg=dQSjn&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=CSBTXZF6A6W0V47XQ9K2&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=voxpop06-20&amp;linkId=52ce11b0b298f43743aa80f6f5b0008a\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" target=\"_blank\"><noscript><img border=\"0\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B01M0BINU7&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=voxpop06-20\"/></noscript><img border=\"0\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B01M0BINU7&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=voxpop06-20\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/></a><i>He waited until they’d obeyed, then said, “All right, get your hands high again an’ keep them there.

Instantly there came a deep, deafening boom as Isom fired one barrel of his shotgun. The man rocked back in his saddle as a hole appeared in the center of his shirt, which instantly turned a deep blood-red. He gurgled in agony, slumped forward, and toppled to the ground.
