And we’re going to need an introductory book to it, given that Steve Keen’s severing of the link between micro and macro renders almost completely irrelevant all those Robinson Crusoe stories meant to illuminate the first foundations of the microeconomy.\nEverything you know about economics is wrong. Also, everything the professional economists know about economics is wrong.\nThat may sound arrogant. That may sound crazy. It is certainly a very strong statement. Nevertheless, it is true, because math does not lie.\nYou see, professional economists make one single very important assumption that underlies their entire profession. This one assumption underlies all of their models, all of their statistics, and all of their fundamental understanding of their studies of human action. They assume that demand is cumulative. What that means is that they assume your preferences, and my preferences, and everyone else’s preferences, can be added together to make one giant set of preferences which can then be utilised in their calculations.\nOr, to put it in a way that those of you with an economic background will recognize, they assume that all individual demand curves are a) stackable and b) follow the same downward-sloping trajectory.\nAs it happens, this is not true.
