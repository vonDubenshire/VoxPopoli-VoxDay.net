It is a story of a young man who doesn’t fit into society because he is morally upright for the decadence that infests modern society. The young man, who will being morally upright isn’t the most introspective fellow or overtly gifted with prudence, follows his path to squirehood and my what a road it is. </i></li><li><i>Outstanding! I really don’t know how else to characterize it besides simply outstanding! I enjoyed Swan Knight’s Son, devoured it in fact, but this one transported me in a way I haven’t been since I was a boy and could read a new book every weekend. The setting is feels like all the best parts of Tolkien, with that same depth lent to it by its roots in classical and Christian lore. The story is, as always, deeply moving and wonderfully worded and paced. I am not being hyperbolic when I say that The Green Knight’s Squire is shaping up into one of those series a boy could read and find that it deeply shaped his life for years to come.</i></li><li><i>An excellent book, and worthy sequel to both Swan Knight’s Son and especially Feast of Elfs. Mr. Wright continues to amaze with his command of the Western canon and English language, to say nothing of his superlative storytelling. These are books I wish I’d had growing up, and find the wonder diminished not at all by reading them as an adult.</i></li><li><i><noscript><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=voxpop06-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B072VKV3K2\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" width=\"1\"/></noscript><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=voxpop06-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B072VKV3K2\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201%201%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" width=\"1\"><i>Another must-read from John C.
