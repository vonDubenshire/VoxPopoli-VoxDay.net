LawDog’s book is right there in authenticity, tone and hilarity. And just as Wambaugh spins his books in a manner that any non-badge toting, gun-holstering civilian can understand, LawDog doesn’t take his readers into the world of quirky and twilight zoned law enforcement–he brings that rarely seen side of law enforcement to the reader and does so with the ease of conversation as though you were sitting around the card table for the weekly poker &amp; cigar night.</i></li><li><i>LawDog is one of the best writers I have ever encountered. I feel like I am sitting around a fire, hearing stories from a favorite uncle. His descriptions are hilarious and his “translations” of colloquialisms are incredibly creative and spot on.</i></li><li><i>About the time I was reading about the “Serving Platter of Doom +3”, I was laughing hard enough that I couldn’t see the page. If your eyes are dry after reading about Mr. Johnson, you have no soul. I recognized the “two beers” from my own time in law enforcement. All in all, I enjoyed this book far more than I should have, and I suspect you will too. It gives you a mostly unvarnished look at a few moments in the life of a law enforcement officer.</i></li></ul></div>",
