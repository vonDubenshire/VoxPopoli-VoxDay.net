Of course it should not be that they are innocent, but the message should always be that if we didn’t have the Jews we could figure out how to deal with non-Whites very easily.</p><p>The same deal with women. Women should be attacked, but there should always be mention that if it wasn’t for the Jews, they would be acting normally.</p><p>What should be completely avoided is the sometimes mentioned idea that “even if we got rid of the Jews we would still have all these other problems.” The Jews should always be the beginning and the end of every problem, from poverty to poor family dynamics to war to the destruction of the rainforest….</p></blockquote><p>The way they always talk about the Daily Stormer being “the biggest Alt-Right site” is not an accident.

If you notice, I have nearly three times more followers on Gab than Anglin, 19,209 compared to 7,517, probably because it is much harder to create fake accounts and buy followers on Gab than on Twitter.  I expect that they have been manipulating the Alexa rankings in the way I have demonstrated can be done with as few as 30 people.
