Before we grab  our Deerstalker Cap and hold our magnifying glass up to Superversive  Press’s latest collection, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MAGA-2020-Beyond-Milo-Yiannopoulos/dp/1925645487/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510686724&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=maga+2020\"><span style=\"color: #0066cc;\">MAGA 2020 &amp; Beyond</span></a>”, we need to get something out of the way.</p><p>This is not message fiction.</p><p>For  decades, “message fiction” has been used to describe “ugly left wing  lies wrapped up inside pretty fiction packages”.  Mainly because that  was the only message fiction available.  Right wing message fiction was  consigned to the dustbin of unpublishable  Now that the Pandora’s box of  self-and small press publishing has been opened, the peddlers of  message fiction and their supporters want to change the meaning of the  term to encompass <em>all</em> fiction with <em>any</em> message. But  just as they no longer get to decide which messages are conveyed via  fiction, they also no longer get to decide the definition of “message  fiction”.  And so the meaning retains its stink of left-wing  propaganda.  Hence, this collection of pro-Trump essays cannot be  classified as “message fiction”.</p><p>Granted, MAGA 2020 &amp; Beyond”  is filled, cover to cover, with the exact same sort of heavy handed  symbolism and wishful thinking and oversimplification you would expect  given the title and cover art. And yet it isn’t message fiction, because  the messages conveyed by these tales are neither ugly, nor left wing,  nor are they predicated on a view of the world that just ain’t so.   These works represent a direct challenge to message fiction.</p><p>So it isn’t message fiction, but is it any good?</p><p>Some  of it is good.  Some of it is great.  Some of it is lousy.  I can’t  tell you which is which, though.  That you’ll have to discover for  yourself.</p><p>This collection contains thirty pieces of fiction and  non-fiction, many of them by well recognized authors such as Brad  Torgerson, L. Jagi Lamplighter, Declann Finn, Milo, Ivan Throne, John C.  Wright, and Jon Del Arroz. It also includes works by rising stars such  as Alfred Genesson, Dawn Witzke, Marina Fontaine, and the inimitable  @Kaijubushi.</p><p>While the writing snaps and pops across the board, the  styles of works in this eclectic collection of authors runs the gamut.  The tone of the stories varies wildly, from Del Arroz’s over-the-top  wahoo story of a TrumpMech piloted by young Barron fighting an  irradiated Kim Jong-Unzilla (spoilers!) to the Christine Chase’s much  more understated tale of a young woman serving as the audience for her  grandmother’s reminisces about the days of fighting the black bloc and  driving them from the streets way back in the early 2020’s. The weight  of the message varies within the works as well. Sometimes the point of  the story is a thin patina, as in Marina Fontaine’s story of a man  coming out of the conservative closet and admitting his wrongthink to  relatives. Sometimes it has all the subtlety of a Neil Blomkampf movie,  as in Scott Bell’s story of police officers forced to head into the  bleak hellscape of a city set aside as a reservation for socialists to  live out their dreams of starvation and death camps where their idiocy  can’t hurt decent Americans.</p><p>As to the non-fiction, they covering  an equally wide spread of political ground. Ivan Throne offers an  apologia for Trump that resonates with those who appreciate the  multivariate ways in which the God-Emperor operates to destabilize the  Deep State. John C. Wright’s unique erudition shines through as bright  as ever in his think piece on how the cockroaches have and continue to  scurry about in the wake of the 2016 election. My personal favorite of  the non-fiction pieces is Monalisa Foster’s essay on the nature of  language and her experience as a right-wing writer bobbing along in a  sea of the left-wing subculture of writing.</p><p>That broad spectrum of  approaches solidifies the book’s appeal for those across the political  spectrum – at least that part of it that lies to the right of NPR.  Edited by Jason Rennie, an excellent judge of work and a fine editor,  “MAGA 2020 &amp; Beyond” in unafraid of a little experimentation.  Some  of the experiments work, and some don’t, but they are all worth reading,  if only to find out where your personal line lies between “fun” and  “preachy”.</p><p>The skinflints among this book’s readership will feel  likely cheated and argue that the works they don’t like somehow took  enjoyment away from the works they do. That’s an unfortunate way to view  this book, given that one of the underlying themes that consistently  occurs in each work is a message of optimism and hope for the future.  Like America herself – like Trump himself for that matter – this is not a  perfect book. It has a few sour notes and no one will like everything  they find between its covers, but on the whole, this book is fantastic.  It stands for something much greater than itself, and it inspires those  who embrace it to do more, to do better, and to make more of themselves.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that <em>MAGA 2020 &amp; Beyond</em> largely forgoes pessimistic sneering at the common culture in favor of a  more sunny approach.  This book oozes with optimism and takes the path  of building something worth reading rather than conducting more Monday  morning quarterbacking of the dumpster fire that is American media.   It’s a positive approach to replacing the dumpster fire with a roaring  backwoods bonfire, complete with an invitation to men of good will to  join in the laughter and fun.  In that, this book also represents  another example of the shift in the cultural war from a decades long  Republican rear-guard action to an aggressive attack by the right-wing  newcomers who seek to capture the cultural high ground through building  something up rather than trying to tear something down.  As such, this  book represents a far more effective action than all of the think pieces  ever written by the National Review crowd.</p><p>Of course, the real  question for readers is whether or not this collection is worth the  money, and the answer to that is a resounding YES.
