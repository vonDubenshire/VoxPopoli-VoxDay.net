The first 24 pages of <i>Quantum Mortis: A Man Disrupted</i> will be done by the end of the year as well.</p><p>Just in case any backers missed the email, I should mention that backers are permitted to add to their backing in the event they would like hardcovers instead of paperbacks, or paperbacks in addition to digital editions, or whatever. Just email me to let me know of any additions; those of you who have already done so will receive confirmations later this week. The current plan is to release 24-page versions in digital format when they are ready, then publish the trade paperbacks and hardcovers once the necessary six 24-page versions are complete. Each 48-page volume will consist of two 24-page books illustrated by the same artist.</p><p>We will also be sharing some more new artwork tomorrow as part of the launch of a major new site.</p></div>",
