When they offered her a chance at her own reality show down the road, she really listened. When they told her that her A- list (PJ) celebrity husband was going to divorce her and enforce that prenup, she was 100{84e33cb3079486242e497491211df3d205f46b3a0e51fcdbcd64cea5b9aea06c} on board.</p><p>They provided her with drugs that were much stronger versions of the ones her husband used to take.

She might not have been there to commit the actual crime, but she was part of the conspiracy to kill him and she has had no problems with the money and fame she has received after his death.

A widow who became one not that long after the first. She was married to an A- lister (RJ) herself. She would never have done anything to harm her husband. Nothing.
