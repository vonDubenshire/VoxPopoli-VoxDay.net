This was for his eldest daughter as a graduation gift along with a copy of SJWAL.</p><p>His wife took one look at the shirt and laughed with pleasure “That is PERFECT!”</p><p>Daughter loves it. The fabric is soft and the cut is feminine.</p><p>The normal, happily-married “my husband is awesome” response to this t-shirt is “too funny” and “I love it” from females. God knows what wheels go a-spinning in high strung males-ville, not being one myself.</p><p>Thanks for a great product.</p></blockquote><p>The lesson, as always, is this: never, ever, listen to advice about women from Gamma males, no matter how “red-pilled” they claim to be. And pay no mind to the opinions of the childless about how you raise your children. They have literally no idea what they’re talking about, nor does it even occur to them that this is more of a warning to pedos and other sexual predators than potential boyfriends.</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://crypto.fashion/products/that-red-dot-on-your-chest-means-my-daddy-is-watching-ladies-tee-v-neck\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-original-width=\"640\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1409/4398/products/Red_Dot_Black_V_Front_1024x1024.png?v=1512511580\" width=\"255\"/></a></div></div>",
