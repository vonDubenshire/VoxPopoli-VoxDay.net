She is retired so she has plenty of free time and has always been the neighbor that snoops in everyone’s business and selectively complains about neighbors she does not like violating minor rules. She had been working on updating the community rules book when she quit and the rest of the board wanted to allow her to stay on the rules committee.

The board has turned over through resignations and only myself and one of her minions remain on the board. The other 3 board members and I agree to place a deadline on the rules committee. To spare you the gory details you don’t care about, the committee submitted a proposal on time after much complaining about deadlines.</p><p>The board was in the process of reviewing it and suddenly she started meeting, in secret with her minion and working on proposed modifications. We had a board meeting and her minion submitted her proposed changes, we voted on each one individually and some passed and some failed. The next day we get an angry email from her about how we were violating the law if we did not write the rules the way she had proposed. That she as a member of the rules committee she should have been invited to the meeting and included a PS that said the email was to voice her objection to our proposed rule because it was illegal – it’s not – and she didn’t want to be implicated if the association were sued by a concerned resident.</p><p>I wrote the response and made clear they were my opinions alone. I informed her she was not invited because the rules committee was dissolved after the deadline voted upon. I pointed out where she was wrong about the things we rejected and asked her to cite relevant law on the things she was claiming were illegal. I finished the note saying I, personally, did not appreciate the veiled threat in the post script.</p><p>She wrote an response to the whole board about how she was crying just reading my “hateful” email. She doubled down and claimed she had legal opinions to back up her assertion. She complained about how it was disrespectful of us to put a deadline on her and the other committee members etc. etc.</p><p>Next morning I decided to respond. I prefaced the email saying I wasn’t going to go point by point with her because I didn’t think it would be beneficial. I then stated that I was going to state three things without malice or ill will towards her. The first thing was stating that respect is a two way street and asked her to honestly consider why she has unresolved conflicts with multiple neighbors (the number is close to 30{84e33cb3079486242e497491211df3d205f46b3a0e51fcdbcd64cea5b9aea06c} of the neighborhood).  The second statement was that I would pray that she finds peace and contentment in her life because in 7 years I had noticed that these were things she struggled to achieve (she is a churchian). The third was the simple statement “I will not be bullied”.</p><p>I get the reply later that morning. “Stop harassing me immediately” She references her email sent to the whole board about not wanting emails and I wasn’t respecting her wishes. Then the bingo moment “I call this harassment, especially because I am a woman”. She then threatens to contact the police and have her and her husband make sworn statements that I am harassing them if I ever speak to or email either of them again.</p><p>I was a little taken a back by this at first, reread my emails and realized they were tame and fact based, and was thankful for the fact that I sent copies of all correspondence to the board immediately before sending to or after receiving anything from her. I have 2 board members solidly backing me independently sending me emails that had the same sentiments of “good job, it’s time someone confronted her” and “you were much kinder than I would have been”. The same two initiated separate motions to the board about not allowing her to participate on any committees again, and seeing if there is anything we can do about her threatening a board member.</p></blockquote><p>The fundamental mistake, of course, was giving this SJW the chance to have any input on the rules after she stepped down from the board. But this is a pretty textbook situation, from the board members naively failing to anticipate the SJW’s bad behavior to everyone being surprised by the shameless lies and counterattacks that to which an SJW who feels threatened invariably resorts.</p><p>Fortunately, the emailer was prepared, although it was a complete waste of time to babble about respect and prayer and personal lives.
