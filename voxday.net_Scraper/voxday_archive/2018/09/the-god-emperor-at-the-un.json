He always makes these speeches so long. Anyway, here’s a summary of each paragraph of Trump’s 2018 UN speech</p><p>1. Listen up, bitches<br>2. I pretty much already covered all this shit last year, but I guess it bears repeating<br>3. Check it out, I’ve been on a roll<br>4. My administration is better than all the other presidential administrations the US has ever had. I’ve made these last two years my bitch<br>5. Why’s everybody laughing at me?<br>6. Not to brag or anything but I basically saved the entire economy. Even minorities have jobs now.<br>7. Taxation is theft and we’re building The Wall<br>8. You thought our military was fucking hardcore before? Sheeet, wait until you see them now that we’re actually paying them<br>9. Thanks to me, AMERICA, FUCK YEAH!<br>10. America First<br>11. Globalism is shit<br>12. Cultures are distinct, so act your culture<br>13. America likes to declare independence. We’re gonna declare independence from the rest of you globalist sons of bitches<br>14. Do you, boo<br>15. Let us do us<br>16. So I just got back from a world tour and everybody who matters likes me<br>17. I even got the Norks to chill the fuck out<br>18. No shit, there I was: Staring Rocket Man in the face<br>19. It’s alright though, I smoothed it out<br>20. Dude’s getting rid of his nukes and giving us back our dead bodies we’ve been wanting back<br>21. Not too shabby, Li’l Kim. (Don’t fuck this up)<br>22. Everybody who helped out with that is cool in my book. It was pretty much the greatest peace talk ever talked. Just sayin’<br>23. Shout out to Real Korea, Japan, and China</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p><p><a name=\"more\"></a><br>24. Oh, and I’m fixing the Middle East, too<br>25. I put most of the countries there to work fucking over Iran and ISIS<br>26. They’re spending money to help with Syria and Yemen, too. Ya hear that Iran? We can outspend your fucking Obama money<br>27. But, I don’t really want to get involved<br>28. Except when I do, so I’ve been delegating to the less fucked-up sand countries<br>29. I FUCKING KILLED ISIS!<br>30. Syria’s a damn shitshow. But so help me, if I see one more chemical weapon attack…<br>31. Glad to see Jordan is taking in refugees from Syria. Better you than me, Abdullah<br>32. But seriously, it’s a lot better than flying them all the way over here. RIGHT, EUROPE?<br>33. Iran’s trying to get away with its involvement? YOU THOUGHT!<br>34. Fuck you, Iran! I know what you’ve been up to, you garbage-ass regime! All you do is ruin everything else for everyone else, you miserable sons of bitches!<br>35. Seriously, even your own citizens are sick of your shit, Iran! Where’d all that Obama money go, eh Iran? Terrorism? Yeah, I’m sure your people are just THRILLED about that! 0/10 all around, Iran<br>36. The Iran Deal was shit, and everybody knows it<br>37. We basically funded their military dictatorship, nuclear weapons programs, and terrorism. Thanks, Obama<br>38. -But then I came to tooown- and let Iran know who’s boss. DEAL’S OFF, BITCHES!<br>39. Like, seriously, who the fuck thought letting Iran have nukes was a good idea?<br>40. Everybody point and laugh at Iran’s government. Their people are cool, though. #IranProtests<br>41. Jerusalem? More like Jew-rusalem, amirite?<br>42. Let’s clear some shit up about the Israel conflict, alright? Israel has a right to exist.<br>43. Fuck what you used to do, we’re being pragmatic, here.<br>44. You ain’t gonna take advantage of the US anymore, you freeloaders.<br>45. I’m sick of all this “made in China” crap<br>46. We buy all their shit and they don’t buy all of our stuff and they do all that skeezy, nerdy, accountant stuff to take advantage of us<br>47. No more, I say!<br>48. So I made some great deals with Mexico and Real Korea. Expect yuge discounts on taco bowls and Samsung phones<br>49. The WTO is a fucking joke.<br>50. China took all our manufacturing jobs<br>51. THAT SHIT ENDS NOW, CHINA!<br>52. Would you like some tariffs with your rice?<br>53. America First<br>54. The UN Human Rights Council is a fucking joke, too<br>55. Y’all wouldn’t listen to Nikki Haley when she told you that<br>56. So deuces, we out<br>57. Same with your International Criminal Court. It’s all bullshit<br>58. You have no power, here, G̶a̶n̶d̶a̶l̶f̶ ICC<br>59. Everyone should leave the EU. Run your own damn countries<br>60. America’s killin’ it in the energy industry<br>61. We have so much energy to sell<br>62. Those other oil-producing countries will rip you off and that makes me angry<br>63. Seriously, it’s a scam. They’re like the Comcast of countries. Stop falling for it.<br>64. Poland is way smarter than Germany<br>65. Men of the West! Protect yourselves from foreign influence!<br>66. The Monroe Doctrine is back and better than ever!<br/>67. Now about those Mexican immigrants, they’re being trafficked. Lame<br/>68. It’s all the street gangs and cartels. Getting rid of them, and building The Wall, are the only ways to fix things<br/>69. Your country, your immigration rules. Our country, our immigration rules. Fuck that “global citizen” malarkey<br/>70. Make Your Countries Great Again<br/>71. SOCIALISM. DOESN’T. WORK.<br/>72. Venezuela used to be great, but then along came socialism. Now it sucks.<br/>73. Socialism and Communism have never worked, never will work, and only ever result in tragedy. It’s the Goddamn worst<br/>74. We’re making Venezuela great again by hitting Maduro and his entourage in the pocket books. We were able to identify their pocketbooks because they’re THE ONLY ONES IN THE COUNTRY WHO HAVE THEM<br/>75. The UN tries, we’ll give you that<br/>76. But the US is still better at charity. Seriously, we give and give and nobody ever returns the favor. So we’re gonna be a lot more stingy with our wallets until the entire world stops taking us for a ride<br/>77. So we’re only going to give money to the cool kids. And we’re not going to protect you guys, either. Time for you to buy your own militaries<br/>78. The UN could be cool if it just changed everything about it<br/>79. And we’re only going to pay for the stuff we like, now, too<br/>80. Start pulling your own weight, you damned freeloaders<br/>81. The UN is good in concept, terrible in execution<br/>82. Every country has something to contribute<br/>83. India’s doing great<br/>84. Saudi Arabia’s shaping up<br/>85. Israel’s still here, bitch!<br/>86. Poland’s had enough of your shit, EU<br/>87. All cool things, if I do say so myself<br/>88. Distinct borders and cultures make the world a better place<br/>89. Things just work out better with cultural homogeneity<br/>90. America’s gotta America<br/>91. America, FUCK YEAH!<br/>92. Love your country like Americans love America<br/>93. Patriotism: It’s what’s for dinner<br/>94. Shhhh. Don’t fight it. Just let it happen<br/>95. In order to make it work though, YOU NEED A BORDER AND SOVEREIGNTY<br/>96. You’ll do better, the world will do better. Everybody wins<br/>97. MOTHAFUCKIN’ FREEDOOOOM!!<br/>98. Well, time to hit the ol’ dusty trail<br/>99. You’ve been a great crowd. Thank you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></div>",
