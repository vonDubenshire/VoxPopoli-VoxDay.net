one radio<br>show and podcast the ben shapiro show<br>ben shapiro i appreciate it i always say<br>this the conservatives will come on our<br>show I’m a little jealous of their guts<br>because they’ve more guts than the<br>liberals liberals don’t go on<br>conservative shows they didn’t come on<br>this show sometimes so I appreciate cuz<br>you know the crowd is not with you I got<br>that impression yeah and but yeah we<br>should but we ran let’s be civil right<br>that’s the tone of the day and I’m the<br>fan okay so I’m a fit well let’s see if<br>I’m a fan see each other’s fan at the<br>end admire but I just want to say we<br>seem to be living in a time of utter<br>tribalism and I think you and I have a<br>few things in common besides we were<br>both uninvited at Berkeley but we’ve<br>been coy about our affiliation of like<br>I’ve never really wanted to say I was a<br>Democrat I always voted Democratic but<br>they disappointed me a lot<br>you know you’ve been coy about a you<br>were Republican you’re conservative or I<br>think right now I’m a Democrat and and<br>since all the Republicans are now<br>backing Trump except for the ones who<br>are leaving but he totally owns that<br>party now if you’re if you’re a<br>conservative aren’t you really team<br>Trump</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p><p>well it depends on on what so what<br>I’ve called myself is sometimes Trump<br>okay there the people said there’s never<br>Trump and there’s always from sometimes<br>Trump meaning that when he does<br>something that I like I cheer and when<br>he does something that I hate which<br>happens then I boo and I’m blowing as<br>loudly as you are when he does something<br>that’s really bad but listen you’re very<br>upset about the Supreme Court nominee I<br>am very pleased about the Supreme Court<br>nominee as a conservative right he’s<br>doing a lot of things that I like in<br>terms of policy now that doesn’t mean<br>that I am cheering his character because<br>I think that it is very difficult to<br>cheer Donald Trump’s character nor do I<br>think it’s appropriate well what do you<br>like okay so I like the tax cuts I like<br>to tax it hurts me by the way in<br>California but I like it as a general<br>policy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p><p>ladies he’s rich. okay okay but see I don’t even know what<br>the Republican beliefs are I mean you’re<br>a young guy but you certainly remember<br>two years back when they were beliefs<br>were completely the opposite of what<br>they are now when it’s free trade they<br>were giant deficit hawks yep the Tea<br>Party was all about we’re gonna solve<br>the deficit but they didn’t did that<br>well the Democrats ain’t can do it<br>either so I know but they didn’t say<br/>they were right the Tea Party kept said<br/>we have got to get this deficit down<br/>this motherfucker has ran up a trillion<br/>dollars in six months what what what<br/>about Russia they used to be the enemy<br/>what about free trade I mean how do you<br/>turn on a dime so quickly in a couple of<br/>years</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p><p>I mean obviously it’s been very<br/>frustrating to me watch so many<br/>Republicans do exactly that I’ve been<br/>incredibly critical of Republicans who<br/>have suddenly become fans of Vladimir<br/>Putin or have suddenly become fans of<br/>tariffs I think all of that is idiocy<br/>but again I think that with regard to<br/>judges with regard to taxes with regard<br/>to Middle Eastern policy particularly<br/>Iran in Israel I’m much more of a fan of<br/>President Trump than I certainly would<br/>have been of Hillary Clinton or Barack<br/>Obama and by the way I didn’t vote for<br/>president from the last election because<br/>of my concerns about him okay so you<br/>would not vote for a Democrat under any<br/>circumstance or some circumstance I mean<br/>I would say some circumstance but the<br/>Democratic Party would have to stop<br/>being insane meaning that they would<br/>actually have to approach something like<br/>moderation in terms of policy and also<br/>present a face that doesn’t look like<br/>people shouting down people at gas<br/>stations or entering restaurants and<br/>trying to throw them out okay well if<br/>you’re talking about the civility thing<br/>why don’t we start with the Republicans<br/>stop saying lock her up you don’t think<br/>that’s a worse a bridge winter<br/>just lock her up he talked about locking<br/>co me up he talks about locking<br/>journalists up there’s a guy who said<br/>locked tim kaine up how about we stop<br/>the lock them up shouldn’t disability<br/>arguments start there before we care<br/>about who gets their entree well it<br/>isn’t just about who gets their entree<br/>I’m not gonna make excuses for which is<br/>more important well I think that all of<br/>it is important if you’re going to ask<br/>me is bad across the board yes but you<br/>can’t be advisors that we’re only<br/>imposed okay you’re only opposed to<br/>incivility when it’s Donald Trump<br/>inclusive but but suddenly Maxine Waters<br/>auntie Maxine because Ben you can’t walk<br/>into a Roman tea an elephant in a mouse<br/>and not know which one is bigger but<br/>it’s not no offense any Mouse it’s two<br/>years really yes threatening to walk six<br/>hundred officers to protect me at<br/>Berkeley yes it’s an elephant and an<br/>elephant yes it’s an elephant an<br/>elephant a trilobite in 2010 Romney that<br/>he’s gonna put y’all back in Chains<br/>about black people this stuff<br/>pre-existed that productive is terrible<br/>didn’t come from the president at<br/>Berkeley it came from the vice president<br/>when he was saying Mitt Romney the<br/>cleanest person ever okay was a guy<br/>who’s gonna put y’all back and change to<br/>pretend in civility started with Donald<br/>Trump not instability at the level to<br/>which it’s at were your time great you<br/>do you really think Donald Trump<br/>respects the rule of law I mean if<br/>somebody no and I think the Constitution<br/>itself is a pretty damn durable document<br/>thank God I’ve read your tweets like<br/>about Kamala Harris yeah I have some<br/>problems with her too but you would vote<br/>for Trump over her yes tell me why okay<br/>so the reason I’d vote for Trump over<br/>her is because I agree with him a lot<br/>more on policy and I actually believe a<br/>lot of the damage that he has done to<br/>the country in terms of social fabric<br/>has already occurred so I said I didn’t<br/>vote for him in 2016 the reason I didn’t<br/>vote for him in 2016 is because I feared<br/>the damage he would do to the social<br/>fabric and I also didn’t think he was<br/>going to govern conservative because I<br/>didn’t see a lot of indicators of that<br/>he’s government a lot more conservative<br/>than I thought he was going to and as<br/>far as the damage to the social fabric<br/>if he’s already done it I’m not actually<br/>mitigating against the damage to the<br/>social fabric by not voting from in 2020<br/>can I read your here’s something where<br/>we sort of agree and then I’ll show you<br/>where we don’t this is Kamala Harris<br/>tweeted children are our nation’s future<br/>we must listen to them about what they<br/>care about and give them a voice in our<br/>government<br/>and you wrote ridiculous I’m with you<br/>their children they don’t get a voice<br/>and I think I know what she meant but<br/>it’s poorly worded and you wrote<br/>children should not have a voice in our<br/>government their children and you’re<br/>right this is where the left drives me<br/>crazy but then you wrote about children<br/>they are also incapable of fully<br/>rational thought<br/>thoroughly uncivilized and completely<br/>driven by immediate emotional response I<br/>can’t think of a here more perfect<br/>description of Donald Trump you didn’t<br/>see the irony when you wrote that tweet<br/>and described children that way you did<br/>it didn’t never entered your mind that<br/>Donald Trump fit that perfectly well I<br/>don’t believe that Donald Trump is a<br/>person whose views are leading in in my<br/>in my imagination where the country<br/>ought to go I mean I don’t look to<br/>Donald Trump’s a thought leader I would<br/>look to a child’s thought leader I don’t<br/>look to those it’s not leader so are you<br/>talking about he’s the president says<br/>he’s not the thought leader nope<br/>couldn’t he have some thought I don’t<br/>know Kenny<br/>you tell me I don’t know well it seems<br/>like his only thoughts to me are to work<br/>with Vladimir Putin to make Russia great<br/>again and I what I don’t understand<br/>Obama was but harsher on Putin you got<br/>in terms of his rhetoric his actions his<br/>armed his armed the people of Ukraine<br/>with deadly weaponry which Obama would<br/>not do 200 Russian soldiers were killed<br/>in Syria by US forces under Donald Trump<br/>not under Barack Obama Barack Obama who<br/>sang to Dmitry Medvedev that he wanted<br/>to bribed him with flexibility in 2012<br/>it Crimea was annexed under Barack Obama<br/>Wow this reminds me of when people<br/>Hitchin just to come on the show and and<br/>try to convince me that Saddam Hussein<br/>was you know a radical Islamist when he<br/>was actually a secularist you have to go<br/>a long way to make that argument I mean<br/>he tweeted yesterday defending Putin<br/>against what our own agency say that he<br/>said Russia says again they did in metal<br/>not election what a lot of crappy stuff<br/>why a lot of wood why have there been 19<br/>indictments and six conviction so far in<br/>the mullah ring Creek why so many<br/>lies about so many meetings with so many<br/>Russians so many attempts to have<br/>back-channel sources what actually think<br/>that Donald Trump collude admitting yes<br/>I do not because I watched that campaign<br/>I don’t think that Donald Trump could<br/>collude with his own left foot well I<br/>don’t think he did it but his you know<br/>his son did it his the people who and<br/>when the evidence comes out I’m happy to<br/>go for the indictments I’m fine okay<br/>great<br/>criminal activities criminal act but you<br/>see didn’t do but wearing his to<br/>ignorance who have done it well<br/>he’s not too ignorant he’s not too<br/>ignorant to be a criminalist all life<br/>[Applause]<br/>into the Trump Defender here but is he a<br/>doofus or is he an evil genius you gotta<br/>pick one okay actually you don’t you<br/>don’t have to pick one really look I’m<br/>not saying he’s like Hitler here is I<br/>marry bud Hitler was crazy and he was a<br/>genius at what he did which was lie and<br/>manipulate people so you can be both<br/>oka<br/> y but let’s get back to Russia<br/>because I first of all why a nice Jewish<br/>boy like you wants to be on Team treason<br/>I have no idea<br/>dude I’m happy to wait for the Muller<br/>indictments and come down and they<br/>target Trump I’m happy to see them<br/>impeach work that I need to see evidence<br/>but you know that the Republican<br/>Congress we saw it this week with<br/>Rosenstein on the at Congress they are<br/>trying to impeach Rosenstein so they can<br/>get rid of him so they can so we don’t<br/>ever see they don’t want us ever to see<br/>it they know there’s something probably<br/>a thousand things in there that are<br/>incredibly damning okay you don’t think<br/>that if they impeach Rosenstein yes some<br/>presento line for you i don’t know it’s<br/>the final line because there’s still<br/>another step that has to happen Rosen<br/>scene has to be replaced by somebody who<br/>then fires Muller so frozen Steen is<br/>fired and Muller is left to his own<br/>devices which is basically by the way<br/>what happened with this investigation<br/>when Comey was fired then I don’t see<br/>where the line is Muller is the one who<br/>matters here not report goes to the<br/>Deputy Attorney General and if Trump<br/>puts Scott Baio in that position<br/>he can just throw it in the trash and if<br/>he throws it in the trash or quashes the<br/>muller investigation then yes<br/>impeachment should be on the table Thank<br/>You Ben I want to do it again I<br/>appreciate you coming by I know Friday<br/>night’s a tough one for you all right<br/>Ben Shapiro I’ll give him the hands</p></div>",
