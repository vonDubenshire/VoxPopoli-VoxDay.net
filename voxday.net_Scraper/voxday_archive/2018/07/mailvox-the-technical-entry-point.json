What this new process does is require it to be broken down into a dozen individual 2 week tickets with what needs to be completed – yes, a real deliverable – a each point. You might recognize this as the hardest part of any nontrivial change or addition. But Danny Diversity can’t even begin to understand how to do anything for the complex subproject, but can copy a bubblesort routine when it is needed for sprint #9.

If you are making small patches, easily reversed to something like a website (e.g. add popup for shopping cart), this can work because the granularity is small, testability is high, it is a small mod, not a major design, and can be backed out instantly.

Because Betty Bugwright and Danny Diversity will get their tasks done in the sprint, but either any review will reject them or a clean-up tech debt ticket will have to be added. Can’t let there be a visible pattern of where the accumulation of technical debt is coming from.
