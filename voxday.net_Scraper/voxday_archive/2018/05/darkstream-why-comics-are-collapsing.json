Also, thanks to Hooper, we were able to determine that <a href=\"https://streamlabs.com/voxdayvoxiversity\">the donation system</a> is working but you have to use the Streamlabs system and not the YouTube one, since my channel has been deemed ineligible for both monetisation and SuperChats by YouTube.</i></p><p>What happened is that comics went from being a fairly broadly distributed product to one that was<br>completely dominated by a single distributor. Now, what usually happens in the case of a single  distributor. You can probably guess. They’ve got a monopoly position and so they have a tendency to significantly increase their prices at the expense of everyone else. Remember, the distribution is part of the pie and distribution cannot, by definition, increase the pie, and so it’s always going to have to take something from somebody else.</br></p><p>Now if we’re going to take it, are you gonna take it from Marvel? No, you can’t. Marvel has about  40{434e4795edb8718426f2262f16bc350bda72304c69f2c22d1de5754882bdf177} of the market. Are you gonna take it from DC? No you can’t. because DC is already very closely tied to Diamond. So who do they take it from? Well, when a distributor can’t take it from the suppliers, they take it from the retailers, and that’s exactly what’s happened.</p><p>You know I knew what this situation was going to be even before I knew what the numbers were because I have worked in a distribution retail channel before. My father owned a large supplier in a particular industry and so my first job out of college was actually managing part of the distribution channel, so what that means is that if you look at a normal distributor, the kind of distributor that Arkhaven is working with, the kind of distributor that Castalia is working with, they usually do a 20{434e4795edb8718426f2262f16bc350bda72304c69f2c22d1de5754882bdf177} markup at most.</p><p>Diamond’s markup is 38 percent. And so what that means is that if you run the numbers and you work out the details, then what you see is that instead of taking 11.9 percent of the total retail price of a comic, that would be what a normal distributor takes, Diamond is actually taking 22 percent of the total retail price of a comic. so where does that additional 10 percent come from? Well, it’s not coming from Marvel and it’s not coming from DC, it’s coming from the comic stores. I worked it out, and the comic stores are losing, on average, each of them, $31,885 apiece because Diamond is a monopoly. So that’s what’s killing them, that’s why we’re seeing so many retailers going out of business, and this is not going to improve because the market is declining so everybody is trying to take bigger and bigger pieces out of a smaller and smaller pie.</p><p>I calculate that it’s going to go down from 74 million<i> [correction: 79 million]</i> last year which is well down from you know the previous figure of 86 million, and I believe it’s gonna drop down to 67 million or less by the end of the year.</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://cdn.idka.com/0d39f53f-f829-47f6-abdb-7ddd4b259ffb\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><noscript><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"526\" data-original-width=\"537\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.idka.com/0d39f53f-f829-47f6-abdb-7ddd4b259ffb\"/></noscript><img border=\"0\" class=\"lazyload\" data-original-height=\"526\" data-original-width=\"537\" data-src=\"https://cdn.idka.com/0d39f53f-f829-47f6-abdb-7ddd4b259ffb\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20537%20526%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/></a></div><p>The decline from 100.32 million units in 1997 to 67 million in 2001 is known as the Comics Crash.
