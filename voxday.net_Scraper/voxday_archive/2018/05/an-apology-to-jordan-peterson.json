There’s nothing to it, there’s nothing to argue about it, and so, you know, it’s it’s very difficult for me to deal with Peterson’s defenders because what they do is they inform you that he really means X when he says Y, and so how do you argue with that?</p><p>All you can say is well, no, he said what he said.  They say, no, but that’s because he would get in trouble in Canada, you know, he has to be careful of what he says, and he has to speak this nonsense but what he really means is… you know, then they come up with something.
