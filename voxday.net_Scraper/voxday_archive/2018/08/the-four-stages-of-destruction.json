process which is legitimate  overt and open you can see it with your  own eyes  all you have to do all american mass  media has to do is to unplug their  bananas from their ears open up their  eyes and they can see it there is no  mystery there is nothing to do with  espionage is a slow process which we  call either ideological subversion or  active measures actively Mariotti in the  language of the KGB or psychological  warfare partisan Leninism ideology is  being pumped into the soft heads of at  least three generations of American  students without being challenged or  counterbalance by the basic values of  Americanism American patriotism</p><p>it’s a  great brainwashing process which goes  very slow and it’s divided in four basic  stages the first one being  demoralisation it takes from 15 to 20  years to demoralize a nation the  demoralization process in the United  States is basically completely dissolved  the result you can see most of the  people  graduated in sixties drop outs or  half-baked intellectuals are now  occupying the positions of power in the  government civil service business mass  media educational system you are stuck  with them you cannot get rid of them  they are contaminated they’re programmed  to think and react to certain stimuli in  a certain pattern exposure to true  information does not matter anymore a  person who was demoralized is unable to  assess through information the facts  tell nothing to him  even if I shower him with information  with the authentic proof with documents  the pictures even if I take him by force  to the Soviet Union and showing him  concentration camp he will refuse to  believe it until he is going to receive  a kick in the in his fat bottom when the  military booth crashes his then he will  understand but not before that that’s  the tragic of the situation of  demoralisation</p><p>so basically America is  stuck with the moralization and unless  even if you start right now here this  minute you start educating new  generation of America it will still take  you 15 to 20 years to turn the tide of  ideological perception of reality people  who think they are living at the peace  time holes the United States is in the  state of war undeclared total war the  next stage of course is crisis it may  take only up to six weeks to to bring a  country to the verge of crisis if this  is what will happen in the United States  if you allow all the Schmucks to bring  the country to crisis to promise people  all kinds of goodies and the paradise on  earth just to disturb you lies your  economy to eliminate the principle of  free market competition and to put a big  brother government in Washington DC with  the benevolent dictators who will  promise lots of thing never mind whether  the promises are

others to execute  the others don’t they serve some purpose  wouldn’t they be the one they realized  serve purpose only at the stage of  destabilization of a nation for example  your leftists in United States all these  professors and all this beautiful civil  rights defender they are instrumental in  the process of the of the subversion  only to disability nation when their job  is completed they are not they are not  needed anymore they know too much some  of them when they get disillusioned when  they see that Marxist Leninist come to  power obviously they get offended they  think that they will come to power that  will never happen of course they will be  lined up against the wall and shot</p><p>you  have literally several years to live on  unless the United States wake up the

this is the last country of freedom and  possibility if people will fail to grasp  the impending danger of their  development nothing ever can help United  States you may kiss goodbye to your  freedom including freedoms to  homosexuals to a prison inmate all this  freedom  vanish evaporated in five seconds  including your precious lives the moment  at least part of the United States  population is convinced that the danger  is real they have to force their  government and I’m not talking about  sending letters signing petitions and  all this beautiful noble activity I am  talking about forcing
