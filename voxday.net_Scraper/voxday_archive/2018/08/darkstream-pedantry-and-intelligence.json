And I  especially don’t want to do it every  single time I open my mouth.

It’s a sign  that you’re a jackass. It’s actually a  sign that you’re not very intelligent  because clearly you’re not able to  understand the context. Now, I’m not  saying that if you are genuinely  confused that you shouldn’t ask, obviously, but the correct  question is, the correct way to pose such a  question is, to assume the obvious then  ask to confirm that. That’s the way you  do it. That’s the way intelligent people  do it. I mean one of the signs  of intelligence is to understand things  when you’re only given partial clues. One  of the reasons why C. Auguste Dupin, one of the reasons why Sherlock Holmes,  were considered to be highly intelligent  detectives is because they were able to  ascertain the truth from incomplete  information in a way that most people  couldn’t. So, if you want to demonstrate  your intelligence, don’t pretend not to understand what the  person is almost certainly talking about.</p></div>",
