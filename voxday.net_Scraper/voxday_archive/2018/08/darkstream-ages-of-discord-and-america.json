It’s an academic book it’s  written in a very academic research  style.

The thing that I thought  was particularly striking about it, and  what I’d liked about it, is that Turchin makes a real effort to put things in a  proper historical context. He doesn’t  just come up with a thesis and apply it  solely, or even primarily, to the  situation right now, but he also applies  it to other historical situations. I  believe he had a recent blog post, the  one that I linked to today, where he  talks about how he applied his  calculations to  thirty different historical situations, and that is taking a really intelligent  approach to it. Instead of just  saying, “well I think X is going to happen” and taking shots in the dark, what he did  was he looked at the thirty historical  situations and then measured their  outcomes, and what he came up with should be disturbing to those  who think that things are always going  to work out just fine is that in ninety  percent of the high-stress societal  crises there was what he considers to be  a negative outcome.</p><p>So what he is  projecting, using his own metrics, his own  tools, is a situation that he considers  to be mid to high-level severity, and that ranges from serious societal  disruption to full-blown civil war. Now I  personally don’t subscribe to the  full-blown civil war theory simply  because there are no two obvious sides. I  think that we’re much more likely to see  a breakup and a collapse of the central government as well as the  basic societal narrative rather than two  discrete sides like we had with the North and the South during the U.S. Civil  War of 1861-1865, but what’s particularly interesting about  Turchin’s work is that it’s based on the  concept of measuring societal stress.</p><p>The level of stress in the United States in 2016 was roughly comparable to the level of societal stress seen in 1860, and that’s very, very consistent with observations that you’ve seen from other students of history and military history, where it’s been said everything that’s happening in the United States – I<br>woud actually push that further and I would say everything that’s happening across the West – is essentially positioning for civil war.</br></p></div>",
