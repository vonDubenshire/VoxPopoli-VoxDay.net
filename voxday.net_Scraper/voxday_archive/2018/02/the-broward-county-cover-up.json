The Last Refuge <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheLastRefuge2/status/966854507744374784\">explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I spent about 18 months in 2012, 2013 and 2014 investigating Broward and Miami-Dade school policies and how those policies transfer to law enforcement practices.

The motive was simple.  The school system administrators wanted to “improve their statistics” and gain state and federal grant money for improvements therein. So police officials, the very highest officials of law enforcement (Sheriff and Police Chiefs), entered into a plan.</p><p>As soon as Miami-Dade began to receive the benefits (political and financial) from the scheme, Broward County joined on.  The approach in Broward was identical as the approach in Miami-Dade. It’s important to remember, this was not an arbitrary change – this was a well-planned fundamental shift in the entire dynamic of how teenagers would be treated when they engaged in criminal conduct.</p><p>The primary problem was the policy conflicted with laws; and over time the policy began to create outcomes where illegal behavior by students was essentially unchecked by law enforcement. Initially the police were excusing misdemeanor behaviors.  However, it didn’t take long until felonies, even violent felonies (armed robberies, assaults and worse) were being excused. The need to continue lowering the arrests year-over-year meant that increasingly more severe unlawful behavior had to be ignored.  Over time even the most severe of unlawful conduct was being filtered by responding police.</p><p>We found out about it, when six cops blew the whistle on severe criminal conduct they were being instructed to hide.  The sheriff and police Chiefs were telling street cops and school cops to ignore ever worsening criminal conduct.
