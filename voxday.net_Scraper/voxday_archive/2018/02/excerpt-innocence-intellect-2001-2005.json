The second book of essays. That’s what really let me know I was dealing with an intellect. Vox was calling out feminists and muslims as allies before Obama was President, ten years before Conservative Inc even noticed. Those columns hold up extremely well – if you’ve been on the fence, each essay is about a five minute read and contains the perfect mix of military news, sports comments, leftist lunacy, conservative bumbling.

It’s very interesting discovering how any intellectual figure develops his thought over time, especially when it’s derived from logic and history, which is a rarity at this phase of our decline.
