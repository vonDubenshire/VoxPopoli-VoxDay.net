He began strategically associating himself with any individual, group, or movement, that could potentially gain him more money, power, audience, and influence. 4. His Kavanaugh tweet.

The book is very well researched and builds a very strong case against Peterson’s slippery debate tactics, dishonest character, occult religiosity, and cultish power seeking. The fabulous Milo Yiannopoulos also stops by to contribute an excellent foreword full of substantial incites and great wit. In conclusion: whether you’re an avid follower of Jordan Peterson or an individual casually familiar with his work, you owe it to yourself to read Jordanetics.
