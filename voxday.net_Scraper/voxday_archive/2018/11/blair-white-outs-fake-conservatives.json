So I’ve met almost all of them, people, have either been on their show or  on a show with them, or I went to a  dinner with them, an event with them, or  I became close with some of them that I’ve met that have told me,  either directly or in a roundabout way,  and it’s very clear that they don’t  believe everything that they say that  they believe when they’re on camera.

They pull me aside and say I  just want you to know Blair, I don’t feel  any negative way towards you or trans  people.

You start  learning things like, oh almost all of  them hire people to tweet and Facebook  posts and Instagram on their behalf, tweeting out opinions on their behalf , which I feel like is unethical because  if people were following you because  they believe you’re some intellectual  and they trust your opinion and they’re  gonna shape their opinions a lot of  times on an issue based on your opinion  and it’s not even actually your opinion!
