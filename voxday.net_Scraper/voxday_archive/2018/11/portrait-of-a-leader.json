That is not what I want to do, that’s not my purpose, it’s not my purpose to yell at other professionals, it’s not my purpose to yell at anyone. Really, it’s not my purpose to just say hey what Marvel’s doing, what DC is doing here, and there isn’t right, you know, it indicates that there’s a conspiracy, a leftist conspiracy. I believe in all that and I think that that is true but that’s not what I’m about, that’s not what I’m doing, and I think that’s where the conflict comes in, and I think that’s where the confusion comes in.</p><p>I’m not ComicsGate. I am simply Ethan Van Sciver from Comic Artist Pro Secrets and now All-Caps Comics. That is my comic book company, that is the label that I’m going to publish under. And what does this mean? This means that I am done with ComicsGate. I’m no longer considering myself a part of ComicsGate.</p></blockquote><p>Let me see if I can translate this from 2VSpeak: <i>“IndieGoGo was going to kick me off their platform if I didn’t do something drastic to sever my connection to ComicsGate, so I’m quitting in order to try to preserve my access.” </i></p><p>I told them he was going to stab them in the back.
