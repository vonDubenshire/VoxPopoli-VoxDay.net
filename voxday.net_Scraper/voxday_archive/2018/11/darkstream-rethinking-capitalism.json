You know, those of us who are on  the Nationalist Right have begun to do  that, we’ve begun to question things like  free trade, we’ve begun to question  things like legal immigration. Think about how all the Republicans  and the conservatives who have said for  decade, “the problem isn’t the  immigration the problem is the illegal immigration.”  As we are learning, the problem is actually the legal immigration, you know, legal immigration is just another  word for slow invasion, especially in a  democracy.</p><p>Okay, any time you catch  yourself thinking in that the  problem is not the pure ideal, the  problem is the application of the ideal, that’s been used to try to rescue  everything from communism to feminism to  civil rights.

Patriot 95 says “crony  capitalism is what’s wrong with  capitalism, capitalism untouched and not  corrupted it works well, it’s what grew  America early on,” Well, no, that’s not true.

Everything that he writes about – it’s kind of shocking when you  think about it – he devotes an incredible  amount of time in this very long book to  address the question of  usury and it’s really remarkable how much space he  devotes to Christian theology because  he’s focused on how getting rid of the prohibitions on usury was necessary  for economic development and the modern economic system.</p><p>I started thinking more and more about  the conceptual problems of capitalism  because obviously the issue of debt is a  massive problem, and I’ve demonstrated  this, I’ve dealt with this before. You  know, the biggest single problem with  debt is that it completely warps the  supply-demand curves, and this is without  even getting into Steve  Keen’s mathematical demonstration that  there is no such thing as a collective  supply-demand curve, that you cannot  create a supply-demand curve by adding  multiple supply-demand curves together  so we’re still working within the concept of  conventional economics, we’re still  in the world of Adam Smith here. But once you add debt into the equation, then what you start seeing is people  whose demand is lower than someone  else’s suddenly have the ability to  outbid those who have a higher level of  demand and a greater ability to pay, and  so this turns into a absolute warp of the demand process that completely  eliminates the efficiencies of  capitalism.</p><p>We’re not talking  about crony capitalism here. We’re not  talking about the fact that there are  favored parties and disfavored parties  and that sort thing. We’re simply talking  about the fact that you have the ability  to spend resources you don’t have to  outbid people who have more resources  than you today is intrinsically  introducing a level of inefficiency and  a level of market misinformation that  did not exist before.</p><p>Let me back up for a second. One  of the problems with communism was the  fact that it destroyed the information  that is provided to everyone by the  market, it destroyed the pricing  mechanism, but if you think about it, debt does exactly the same thing! It destroys  the pricing information,  and if you look at the situation that  we’re in now where you have the  elimination of contract law and you have  the elimination of accountability and  contracts and the basic ability to  reliably buy and sell – you know you can be working with Pay Pal one day  and the very next day, even though you’ve  met your obligations and you’ve paid what  you’re supposed to pay and then suddenly  it’s gone – well how can you build a  business based on that kind of  unreliable information foundation? You can’t….</p><p>What is our economy fundamentally built on? It’s not debt, if you think about it. What is our economy fundamentally built on? We know it’s not built on labor. What do we spend all kinds of money on trying to convince people to do? What our entire economy is built on is sales and contracts. It is entirely built upon talking somebody into agreeing to something, the whole concept of exchange.
