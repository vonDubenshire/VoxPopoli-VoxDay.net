And that’s something  that you need to come around to because I understand a lot of you don’t want to  believe that.

You can’t do it  and stand against the evil because it  weakens you. The way that you weaken yourself is  you compromise yourself, and when you are  compromised then you are unable to stand  against the evil of others. You just don’t have the ability. It’s like trying to become a bodybuilder but  saying, you know, I’m not going to work my chest  muscles. I’ll make my legs real  strong and I’ll make my biceps real  strong, but I’m just not gonna do any  bench because I don’t believe in  that. I don’t believe in working my  pectorals. You know, you’re not going to  become an effective bodybuilder.</p><p>If you have a  military operation and you just decide  that we have to do  this operation, we want to  take this objective, we’ve got all these  forces, but you know, I just fundamentally  don’t believe in artillery. I think that artillery is just wrong and  I don’t believe it’s effective,  and so we’ll send in the  infantry, and we’ll send in the armor, and  and maybe we’ll fly some  planes too, but no artillery, because artillery is is just wrong. Well, how  effective is your military going to be? Maybe it’s going to be effective enough,  but it’s not going to be as effective as  it could and should be.</p></div>",
