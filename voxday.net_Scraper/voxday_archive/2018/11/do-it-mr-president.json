I have no choice. Do I want that to happen? Absolutely not, but you’re dealing with rough people. You ask the people in Tijuana, Mexico, they opened up with wide arms, just come in, come in, let me help you, let us take care of you. And within two days, now they’re going crazy to get them out. They want them out. Because things are happening, bad things are happening in Tijuana. And again, it’s not in this country because we’ve closed it up. Actually, two days ago, we closed the border.

It’s really a bad situation.”</p><p>REPORTER: “What do you mean you closed the border and nobody is coming in? What do you mean by that?”</p><p>TRUMP: “If we find that it’s uncontrollable, Josh, if we find that it’s — it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control.”</p><p>REPORTER: “Do you mean the entire border?”</p><p>TRUMP: “The whole border. I mean the whole border. And Mexico will not be able to sell their cars into the United States where they make so many at great benefit to them — not a great benefit to us, by the way. But at least now we have a good new trade deal with Mexico and with Canada. But we will close the border. And that means that Mexico is not going to be able to sell their cars into the United States until it’s open. But we’re going to either have a border or we’re not. And when they lose control of the border on the Mexico side, we just close the border. And we have a very powerful border. We built a very strong border in a very short period of time. And the military has been fantastic, the job they have done. And by the way, Border Patrol and ICE, all of the law enforcement we have involved, and we have local law enforcement, too, they have done an incredible job. And they have wanted this for you know, I’m the first president who’s done to this extent, but they wanted this for years. And some of the presidents, I guess they didn’t care or they wanted open borders.”</p></blockquote><p>President Trump has proven to be an excellent negotiator. No question at all about that. And he’s also shown himself to be considerably more courageous than any politician of either party, up to and including Rep. Ron Paul. I’m not criticizing the man at all, I am aware of what a Herculean task he has taken upon himself, and in fact, the Aegean Stables had nothing at all on the Washingtonian Swamp.</p><p>But the time for positioning and posturing is rapidly coming to an end. The time to deliver on the single most important element of his presidency or become a lame duck is rapidly approaching. Pray for the man, pray that he will be granted all the wisdom and courage and resolve that he requires.</p></div>",
