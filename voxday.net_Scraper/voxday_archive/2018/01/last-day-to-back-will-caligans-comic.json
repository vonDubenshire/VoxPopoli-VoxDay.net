That is because Arkhaven Comics has decided that <i>whether we hit the next two stretch goals or not</i>, we will produce Book #3, whatever the backers decide it will be, and we will produce it <i>in full color</i>. In addition to the ace colorists at Arklight Studios who are contributing their considerable talents at a steep discount for the covers, we have also hired an excellent professional colorist who will color Will’s interior illustrations for Books 1, 2, and 3.
