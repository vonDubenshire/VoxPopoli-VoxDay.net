Well, fair enough, I do concede that. By the same token, Obamacare can make America richer if the alternative is socialized medicine. But, clearly, if we were debating if Obamacare makes us better off or not, I shouldn’t have to be forced to use the default option or the baseline case of an even bigger government policy. So, by the same token here, when I say tariffs don’t make Americans wealthier I am not saying the only other alternative is to say the income tax.
