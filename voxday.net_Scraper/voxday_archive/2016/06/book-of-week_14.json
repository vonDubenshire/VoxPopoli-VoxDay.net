Roosh walks the reader through the entire experience of the tour and its aftermath, from conception to conclusion, in remarkably honest detail. He not only bares his thought processes, he bares his hopes and his fears in a way few writers would dare.</p><p>It is well worth reading, not only in its own right, but also to better understand the way in which the media SJWs and the SJW activists operate when they go into seek-and-destroy mode.</p><p>As some of you know, I played a very small part in helping Roosh turn the tables on the media lynch mob that was attempting to discredit and destroy him; in the section quoted below, Roosh describes how the unexpected viciousness of the attack journalism affected him, how he reestablished his equilibrium, and how he adroitly forced them to choose between serving as his microphone or backing off him and his family.</p><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p> There are many battles in the future that I’m sure we will engage in, but one where a small guerilla army walked out on the open battlefield against a large regiment of infantry that had multiple reinforcements simply wasn’t one of them.</p><p>I firmly believe that it would have been absolute folly to proceed in such an engagement. While I wouldn’t mind gathering my best men and showing up at one of the locations, I couldn’t send others into the meeting when the local hosts weren’t properly vetted and where they didn’t even know beforehand who else would be attending. It was a recipe for disaster, and based on the events that ended up taking place on Saturday, my fears about members being harmed turned out to be accurate.</p><p>At the time the outrage was happening, I happened to be visiting my father’s house in a Washington, D.C. suburb for a short stay before returning back to Eastern Europe. On Thursday, February 4, a news crew with the Daily Mail came to the house while I was sleeping. They failed to hector my stepmom, a gentle Persian woman, into admitting I was there, and camped out in front of the house in the hopes of getting a story.</p><p>I went online, wondering how they were able to find my dad’s address so quickly, and noticed a series of messages from the hacking group Anonymous. It turned out that they had doxed the house earlier that morning. I was already under stress due to the media and government pressure, but now my mood turned to near panic.</p><p>Up to Thursday, I received over 100 threats, many of them credible. Now all of those deranged and gullible idiots had my father’s address. The threats continued to come in, including one that stated my family’s house would soon be burned to the ground. I figured that people would at least try to “swat” the house by making bogus calls to police saying there was a hostage situation inside, or even worse, come to the house and attempt to harm my family.</p><p>The first thing I did was call the local police. I opened the door when they came, not knowing that the Daily Mail had a telephoto lens pointed at the door. After explaining the story, they put a flag on the address against swatting attempts. Besides that, all they could do was advise me to contact the FBI because nearly all the threats were coming in from other jurisdictions. The Daily Mail story went live not long after they left.</p><p><i>Not so cool now!

The dox went viral itself, being viewed over one million times. I had friends from around the world asking me why my family’s address was popping up on their Facebook feed. It may have been the most viewed dox ever.</p><p>The situation seemed dire. After the media successfully painted me as a monster who is trying to legalize rape and organize rape mobs in cities around the world, they added a cherry on top by helping publicize my family’s address to people who wanted me dead. The media, whether deliberately or not, had put my family in great danger. I called a security firm and by nightfall there was an armed guard in front of the house. In the subsequent week, they defended the house against multiple news crews, pizza deliveries, and random men claiming to be plumbers or painters, but who suspiciously lacked work equipment.</p><p>I was relieved when the Daily Mail published a follow-up story claiming that I hired a “burly security guard,” because I knew it would deter people from coming to the house.</p><p><i>The self-styled ‘King of Masculinity’ has called in his own private security guard after claiming he had been threatened.</i><br> <i><br/></i><br> <i>Roosh Valizadeh, who used a blog post – which he later said was satirical – to say that if a woman was on private property she could be legitimately raped, hired the bodyguard as global revulsion over his views grew.</i><br> <i><br/></i><br> <i>When Daily Mail Online attempted to speak to Valizadeh at his mother’s basement where he is in hiding, his guard leaped up and warned our reporter off.</i><br> <i><br/></i><br> <i>He said: ‘I can’t let you go there.
