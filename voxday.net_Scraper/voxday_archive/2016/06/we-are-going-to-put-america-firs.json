  "content_text": "Donald Trump pulls no punches in his speech today on\nwhy he is running for president\n:\nOur country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.\nWe got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on what’s good for America’s middle class – to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.\nWe reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.\nThis is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.\nThis is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.\nWe need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.\nThat’s what we mean by America First.\nOur country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.\nOur Founders understood this.\nOne of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for “the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]” in America.\nHe’s got both economics and history on his side, regardless of what the corrupt globalist economists and historians will tell you.\nI have to say, Trump the Candidate is saying far more of the right things than I would have even expected to hear from Ron Paul.",
