Islam, not only in its extremist forms but in its pure form, is incompatible with modern Western democracy.\nAnd the conflict appears irreconcilable.\nThe policy that should result from this reality is that while we fight side-by-side to annihilate our common enemies, ISIS and al-Qaida, the West should give up the idea of democratization and secularization of the Islamic world.\nAnd those who believe Islam is the one true faith, to which all of mankind must eventually submit, should be told that they are welcome as visitors — but not as immigrants. For that would ensure endless conflict.\nThe more Islamic the West becomes, the less it remains the West.\nAnd really, the West could doesn’t need the visitors either. The outcome is either West becomes East, or Reconquesta 2.0. The sooner the West realizes this, the less violent it will be.",
