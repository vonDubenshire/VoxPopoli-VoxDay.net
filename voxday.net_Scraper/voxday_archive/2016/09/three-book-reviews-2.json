The rise of the Social Justice Phenomenon and their takeover of the mainstream left, and the inability or refusal of the current political elite to address let alone being to deal with a febrile global situation has led to a resurgence of ideas that had for decades been lingering at the fringes.</p><p>Lingering not because they were defeated, empirically wrong or quite quite mad, but because they challenge a set of assumptions without which the current political consensus cannot operate.</p><p>The media’s monopoly on the dissemination of information and their complicity in maintaining a crumbling narrative has been smashed by the cunning and sophisticated use of the internet by alt-right writers. These writers are actually performing the function of the fourth estate and the present American election may be the first where a candidate’s campaign has been undermined by “citizen journalists”.

I do not believe, and have never argued, that “Goodness of religion ⇒ Existence of God [of that religion]”. I believe reading my book with Dominic Santarelli, <b><i><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2azYDll\">On the Existence of Gods</a></i></b>, would suffice to disabuse him of that notion.
