I had to talk him out of putting my name on the cover of <i>MAGA Mindset</i>. Mike regularly mentions me, praises my editing of his book, wrote the introduction to <b><i><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Wnka63\">Cuckservative</a></i></b>, and links to this blog from both Twitter and Danger &amp; Play. Of course, he can’t link to it from Twitter now without risking having his account locked, so he’s wise to avoid doing so.</li><li>Milo is a better speaker than I am. So are a lot of people. I’m not offended that I’m not on his short list of ideal speakers, especially because I never give public speeches anywhere.</li><li>He and Milo are doing social media properly. They have an order of magnitude more social media followers than I do. As Mike himself has told me, I don’t tweet enough. I’m sure he’s right, but a one-way, 140-character-limited medium is simply not my preferred one. I prefer the environment of a blog with comments, probably to my short-term detriment.</li><li>Why would I want to share his platform? I haven’t even used my own Twitter account in weeks. Also, as the Lead Editor of Castalia House, I am his publisher. I have a responsibility to promote our authors, Mike included.
