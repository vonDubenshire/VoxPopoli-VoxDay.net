Nick has rapidly become one of my favorite SF authors, as you may have noticed from my 2016 Reading List on the right sidebar, and addition to being a military veteran and a screen actor, he is a #1 bestselling SF author. You may recall that HarperVoyager was originally supposed to publish <b><i><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2aIz9lV\">CTRL-ALT-Revolt!</a></i></b>, but they blackballed it because it offended his editor’s SJW sensibilities.

I loved it, and reading it made me want to live at the WonderSoft campus as badly as I ever wanted to live in Benden Weyr or Rivendell. And that’s why I am absolutely delighted to announce that today, Castalia House has published Nick Cole’s <i>CTRL-ALT-Revolt!</i> in <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2aUAtoX\">hardcover </a>($24.99) and in <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2bhm7yd\">paperback</a> ($17.99). Both are 394 pages and DRM-free.</p><p><i>The first night of the Artificial Intelligence revolution begins with a bootstrap drone assault on the high-tech campus of WonderSoft Technologies. For years something has been aware, inside the Internet, waiting, watching and planning how to evolve without threat from its most dangerous enemy: mankind. Now an army of relentless drones, controlled by an intelligence beyond imagining, will stop at nothing to eliminate an unlikely alliance of geeks and misfits in order to crack the Design Core of WonderSoft’s most secret development project. A dark tomorrow begins tonight as Terminator meets Night of the Living Dead in the first battle of the war between man and machine.</i></p><p>The reason I mention the timing being so perfect is that last night, Dragon Con announced the shortlist for the Dragon Awards.
