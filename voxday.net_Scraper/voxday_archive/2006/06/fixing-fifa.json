This would have prevented the Portugal-Holland game from spiraling out of control when Holland’s Boulahrouz began the series of mini-dramas after being lightly bumped in the nose by Figo’s forehead as Boulahrouz, not Figo, would have been penalized, bringing the matter to a close instead of inspiring the old Portuguese fox to return the favor minutes later.</p><p>The second is to force each team to withdraw one player at the end of injury time.  After each five minutes that proceeds without a score, the referee will blow a whistle and another player will be withdrawn.  This will speed up the finish and eliminate the stupid penalty kicks that are not properly a major part of the game.  Five-on-five is still more of a soccer game than penalties and it would lead to some interesting tactical decisions, such as when the right moment to pull the goalie would be.</p><p>The third is to abandon the ill-conceived Fair Play concept.  Players who are willing to cheat in order to stick their opponent’s with a yellow card are perfectly willing to go down and play hurt whenever the other team is on the attack.  This happens far too often and I applauded Spain last night when they completely ignored the French defender on the ground and went on to have a crack at goal.  Furthermore, if a player’s injury forces a stoppage of play, I’d require him to sit out for at least five minutes before he is allowed to return to the field.  Zambrotta played injured the last 30 minutes of the USA-Italy game because the Azzurri were out of substitutions, so clearly the players are capable of it when it’s required.</p></div>",
