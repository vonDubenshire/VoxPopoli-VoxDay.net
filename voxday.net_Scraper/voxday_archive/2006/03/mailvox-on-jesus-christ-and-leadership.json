You remember the Father, don’t you? After all, He gave His all, His Son. Or had you forgotten? You know, it’s a leadership thing, giving … but you can’t seem to grasp it.</p></blockquote><p>What a complete crock of stinking nonsense.  Giving cannot possibly be a leadership thing, or God would not require it of everyone.  “We are all leaders!” cry the Gamma Males, “everyone is the same!” assert the Beta Females, all unconvincingly and with no basis in science, Scripture, logic or language.  And in every case, a profound and willful obtuseness towards the words and deeds of Jesus Christ are demonstrated.</p><p>For Jesus Christ did not bitterly demand his rights, he blithely exercised them.  The desperate, defensive attempts to elevate one example of service over the cornucopia of exercises in leadership are hilarious, or at least they would be if one could not see the terrible damage the doctrine the “servant leaders” have pushed on church and society has wrought.  In but a few chapters of a single book, one can see many examples of how he “humbly served”:</p><p>He issues direct orders: “Then Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.” – John 5:8.  “When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.” – John 6:12</p><p>He gives warnings of future consequences: “Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.” – John 5:14</p><p>He understands the principle of delegation: “Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son” – John 5:22</p><p>He delegates and trusts his followers to enact his will: “Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” – John 6:10</p><p>He allows his followers to experience the consequences of refusing his leadership: “On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?”  Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, “Does this offend you?….From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.  “You do not want to leave too, do you?” Jesus asked the Twelve.” – John 6:60-67</p><p>[Note – I regard this to be a key example.  Too many leaders are lured into micromanagement in honest efforts to prevent their followers from making predictable mistakes.  Much better to warn them, allow them to make their own decisions, then let them experience the consquences, including punishment if necessary.  Then remind them that they were warned.  Most will learn to trust the leader, those that don’t are incorrigible and should be fired.]</p><p>His actions are not subject to questioning or explanation: “Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?” – John 4:27</p><p>One thing that has become very clear to me throughout this discussion is how few individuals, male or female, have any concept of what leadership is.  Leadership is not about giving orders, although the leader has to be willing and able to give them.  It is not about controlling others, although the leader has to be in control.  It is not about giving, although the leader has to be willing to sacrifice his interests for the long-term interests of the group he is leading.  The fact that nearly every defender of the “servant leader” myth points to what is obviously poor and ineffective leadership as a substitute for making their case only underlines the fundamental weakness of their position.</p><p>Ironically, the Sports Guy has a better grasp than most on the concept underlying the theological matter.
