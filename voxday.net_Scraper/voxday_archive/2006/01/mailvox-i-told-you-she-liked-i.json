I appreciate that you responded to most of what I had to say.  I am not contending the great things that men have done in the past, even though most was by accident, trial and error, and always with bloodshed.  But lead you to understanding that Mae, Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot are men.  I think I prove my point with just that statement alone.</p></blockquote><p>I always had my suspicions about Mae West.  I am surprised, however, that Sally appears to believe Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot did great things.  She may think that she proved her point by that statement alone, but she is nevertheless still wrong as her original point was that significant human events happened by accident and there is no question that these evil men knew precisely what they were doing in overseeing the murder of millions of individuals.</p><blockquote><p>With technology increasing period is what lead to men and women living longer.  Do you believe that women should be denied health care?  Women are not less of a human because you might be stronger physically.  If this is so then a man who is stronger over another man can enslave the weaker man and treat him less then what the stronger man is.  Do you agree with this?  You would have to if you really are consistent with your our beliefs.  Evolution has helped us get pass the ignorance of the ancient times so I don’t know what time warp you are from.</p></blockquote><p>I realize that the typical female innocence with regards to technology leads many women to believe that it simply grows on trees.  It does not.  As I wrote previously, men and women are living longer due to advances in technology created solely by men.  If technological advancement depended on women, we would still be living in caves, albeit clean caves with fresh wildflowers decorating the interior.  Anyone who can pay for health care should receive it; I will do her the kindness of passing over her inability to grasp the delta between the amount of time required for evolution to make an appreciable difference and the 6,000 years of recorded human history.</p><blockquote><p> I think you are just an angry, lonely, misplaced, distorted individual.  I actually feel sorry for you then disliking you.  If you are in tuned with the world around you, then you will see that the gap in size between women and men is slowly starting to close.  That is because women are educated and are more concerned with their health then with fulfilling men’s fantasies of a submissive woman (which is unhealthy and stunts growth).  Men have not wanted women to be educated because we will find out that we can do everything that men can do.  The way men have forced this in the past is through violence, threats and abusive behavior and it is just not a nature to behave in a violent behavior.  Although, it has been reported that women are starting to have higher levels of testosterone and men having higher levels of estrogen (overall).  Probably why we have the gay community visible, I don’t claim to know it all but continue my education to the best of my abilities for my family and children.</p></blockquote><p>Like every woman on the receiving end of an intellectual beat-down, Sally quickly resorts to the usual passive-aggressive defense and attempts to claim a position of emotional superiority.  Again, what she thinks has absolutely nothing to do with reality or the matter at hand.  The evidence quite strongly suggests that she is wrong, as American women have used their educations – which they now have collectively more of than men – to demonstrate an embarrassing level of intellectual vacuity while seriously degrading the value of a college degree.  An obvious example of that is Sally’s interesting theories with regards to women’s health.  As for the decreasing gap in size, I don’t see the many supersized female porkers one sees lumbering about posing much of a threat to male physical dominance.</p><blockquote><p>Education is not a destination but a continual road.  If women hadn’t been suppressed for the entire length of evolution by men then I am sure today there would hardly be any evidence of greater physical strength.  As far as intelligence there is no difference.  Every individual has their strong points and weak points, even you.  And if you want a bit of extremity then I would say men are really set up to serve women with their physical strength ability (laborers/warriors).  I would also say women with their superior communication, reasoning, compassion, and interpersonal skills are more equipped to deal well in a position of power and authority.   Women are hardly helpless to stop the wars that men create.  Women are not fools at the same time.  When we see a man who has lost his way we simply step back and let him destroy himself.  It seems like men are on self-destruct a lot of the time.  Women are not going to come up and shove a dagger in your chest to overcome the abuse of men because we know that is not the solution.  The solution is a gradual change so that the shock will not cause needless deaths.  Women are not for war.  Those men and women out there are our babies, brothers, loved ones or someone else’s.</p></blockquote><p>If education is a road, then Sally clearly took a wrong turn somewhere.  There are numerous well-proven differences between the sexes with regards to intelligence, involving brain size, modes of thought and measured IQ.  The great irony of women and war is that while women have been the mouthpiece of the anti-war movement since Euripedes, they also tend to be the staunchest supporters of the tyrants who require war to keep the populace quiescent.</p><blockquote><p> I would love to continue this conversation but I am going to mark my place because I have dinner to prepare and the children to tend to and my husband will be home in a bit.  You see I am in the position right now (at home mom) that a lot of men would like but only because I knew that when this desire I have to bear a family is done then I can pursue my own interests, desires, exercise my talents and abilities without suppression.  And if I will counter some kind of suppression I have the right to fight it and make the world a better place for everyone.  Try living in today’s world and stop trying to bring us back to a place of the past filled with despair.</p></blockquote><p>All of this notwithstanding, I credit Sally for putting her family first, although this may be one of the few examples where homeschooling would actually be worse for a child’s mind than the public schools.  As for a place filled with despair for women, the evidence suggests that lies in the future, not the recent past.

You should seek people you believe as you do and you won’t have any problems.  To force your views on someone else is wrong.
