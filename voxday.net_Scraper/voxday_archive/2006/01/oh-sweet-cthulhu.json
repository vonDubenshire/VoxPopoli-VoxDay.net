Next thing I know, I’m in his personal residence. (I don’t exactly know how I got in, but it was kind of implied that the guards knew me and let me in without hassle.) His house was light and airy, kind of like a seaside condo, but stark and stylish. What little furniture he had in there was ultra-modern, Italian leather stuff. The floor was slate or tile. I checked his computer and saw that he had left a message for me – it said that he knew about the plot and was on his way to pick me up. Suddenly he comes roaring up outside in a shiny black car, flings open the door and jumps out looking like Neo without the trenchcoat.
