MacDonald is largely forgotten these days, despite the popularity of books such as “The Princess and the Goblin” and “At the Back of the North Wind”, which the daughter of an American writer named Samuel Clemens enjoyed so much that Clemens wrote to MacDonald requesting a copy to replace his little girl’s beloved, but worn out book.</p><p>Clemens, of course, is better known by his nom de plume, Mark Twain.</p><p>And if MacDonald’s work is forgotten today, the impression it made on three men in a small Oxford literary society will not be.
