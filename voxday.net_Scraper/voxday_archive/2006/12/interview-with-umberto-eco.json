That’s where I got the idea of an island, an island in the Pacific, untouched by human hands. It was interesting that in the case of my character arriving there for the first time – not only for himself, but for all humankind – and watching the things that no human eye had seen before, he didn’t have names for them.  I was excited about telling the story through metaphor, instead of using the names.

What does it mean, the Salman Rushdie persecution, if not to try to destroy a book? We are always trying to destroy something.
