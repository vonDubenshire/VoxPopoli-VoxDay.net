But overturning Hasselbeck’s fumble was the right call, and something that Seattle fans inclined to whine should keep in mind.

Jackson was covered closely, he pushed off and created separation while the ball was in the air; without that separation he would not have been open.

Rothlisberger was awful statistically, but I’ll still take his overall performance over Hasselbeck’s superficially better one.  Rothlisberger stayed calm even when things weren’t going well and made plays to keep the Steelers in it early and clinch it late, while Seattle’s total meltdown during both two-minute drills was downright hysterical.  While Hasselbeck was plagued by Steven’s butterfingers, but he threw big three interceptions even if only two of them were caught.  He also gave up some very crucial sacks that knocked Seattle out of easy field goal range.</p><p>Rothlisberger did keep Seattle in it with that horrible pass in the red zone, but give the big guy credit for getting back and preventing it from becoming a touchdown… again.

Fast Willie’s been in my backfield roster since the second week of preseason… and 12 rushes for 95 yards, one TD is his game.
